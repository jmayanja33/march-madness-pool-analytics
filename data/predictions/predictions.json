Lukosius hit a pair of 3-pointers to help the Bearcats build an early 10-2 lead. Cincinnati led 46-33 at halftime and the Bearcats' defense helped them pull away in the second half as Alabama State went 7 for 30 from 3-point range. Takeaways Alabama State: The Hornets faced a ranked opponent for the first time since the 2021 season when they had consecutive losses to No. 16 Texas and No. 25 Texas Tech. Cincinnati: Last year's leading scorer Dan Skillings Jr. could return soon after being injured in the season opener. Skillings had minor surgery on his knee but began shooting and doing light work in practice this week. Key moment TJ Madlock missed a wide open dunk that would have cut Alabama State's deficit to six points late in the first half. Mitchell responded with six straight points to extend the Bearcats' lead to 39-25. Key stat Connor Hickman, who transferred to Cincinnati after three seasons at Bradley, needed four points to reach 1,000 for his career. He only played 24 minutes due to an injury in the first half and didn't score. Up next Alabama State plays at SMU on Tuesday night, and Cincinnati plays at Villanova also on Tuesday night. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Knox scored 16 points to help the Hornets (20-15) earn a date with No. 1 overall seed Auburn on Thursday in a South Region game at Lexington, Kentucky. \u201cYou just said it: March Madness,\u201d said Alabama State coach Tony Madlock. \u201cI think I\u2019ve talked about this with all of the media, that all of our games end just like this, either we have to get a bucket or we have to get a stop. Fortunately enough we were able to get a bucket to finish this game off.\u201d After forcing a turnover in the final seconds, Alabama State had the ball out of bounds under its own basket. With the score tied, Micah Simpson threw a long pass nearly the length of the court toward a scrum of players in the lane at the other end \u2014 not unlike a Hail Mary in football. The ball deflected off a teammate and right into Knox's hands near the rim, giving him a simple layup for the winning points. \u201cWe put our tallest athletic person to go get the ball,\u201d Knox said. \u201cAnd fortunately everybody tipped the ball, and it landed to me, and I got the rebound and made the layup.\u201d Saint Francis chose not to pressure Simpson on the inbounds pass. Officials determined there was 1 second remaining after Knox\u2019s layup, but a desperation heave by the Red Flash fell short. Saint Francis, which lost its season opener at Dayton, made an unlikely return to the arena as the 19th team to enter the NCAA Tournament with a losing record. Those teams are now 0-19. \u201cThese guys for 34 games left it all out on the court for us,\u201d coach Rob Krimmel said. \u201cI know that they\u2019re disappointed. That\u2019s the thing that I love about them. They\u2019re champions, and nothing can take that away from our group.\u201d Alabama State is making its fifth NCAA Tournament appearance. Micah Octave\u2019s steal and dunk put the Hornets ahead by four with 1:36 left, but the Red Flash tied the score at 68 on Chris Moncrief\u2019s 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining. Juan Cranford Jr., playing in his hometown, led Saint Francis with 18 points. Valentino Pinedo scored 17 for the Red Flash (16-18), who squandered a nine-point lead. Saint Francis shot 59% and went 6 of 12 from 3-point range to take a 39-34 lead into halftime. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in that moment, that situation, a few times this year, and we knew we just had to come out and play ball,\u201d Knox said. \u201cWe stayed positive. We knew as soon as the next half started that we would come out, fly around, play aggressive and just do whatever it takes to win the game.\u201d The Red Flash committed 15 turnovers, leading to 26 points for the Hornets. \u201cWe turned the ball over too many times,\u201d Cranford said. \u201cWe turned the ball over that many times, you can\u2019t expect to come out with a good outcome.\u201d Following a missed shot by Knox down the stretch, TJ Madlock was fouled scrambling for the rebound. He missed the front end of a 1-and-1, but Saint Francis committed a turnover at the other end, setting up the dramatic finish. Up next: Auburn. \u201cI\u2019ll figure that all out tonight,\u201d Tony Madlock said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to enjoy this tonight. We\u2019re going to have this bus ride, I guess a couple hours down the road to play in Lexington at Rupp Arena. How can you beat that?\u201d Seeing red Things didn\u2019t start out so well for Saint Francis. During player introductions, the officials asked several Red Flash players to remove their black undershirts. By rule, undershirts must be the same color as the jersey. Saint Francis wore red. Charity stripe Alabama State didn\u2019t attempt a free throw until there was 5:09 remaining.

    "profile_summary": "Alabama State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 16-seed with a 20-16 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built almost entirely within the SWAC, with a brutal non-conference slate that exposed real limitations against high-major competition. Against power-conference opponents this season, the Hornets went 0-7, losing to UNLV (93-79), LSU (74-61), Cincinnati (77-59), SMU (101-72), Southern Miss (81-64), Missouri (82-65), and Akron (97-78) \u2014 none of those games were particularly close in the final minutes, and the 29-point loss to SMU and the 17-point loss to Missouri illustrated a significant talent gap when facing elite rosters. That said, Alabama State won the SWAC Tournament to earn their automatic bid, beating Texas Southern (84-79), Grambling (64-62), Jackson State (60-56), and St. Francis PA (70-68 in the First Four) in succession \u2014 a four-game postseason run that speaks to genuine toughness and the ability to win when it matters most. Their final five meaningful games show a team playing its best basketball of the season: wins over Alabama A&M (94-52), Grambling (59-47), and then four consecutive tournament wins, capped by one of the most dramatic finishes of the First Four \u2014 Amarr Knox catching a deflected full-court pass and converting a layup with one second remaining to defeat St. Francis PA.\n\nAlabama State is defined by clutch, grind-it-out basketball and an almost pathological comfort in close games \u2014 they have won repeatedly on buzzer-beaters, late free throws, and last-second stops, while also dropping gut-punch losses the same way, such as the Delaware State collapse (83-80) and the Bethune-Cookman losses. Their identity runs through Amarr Knox, who erupted for a career-high 32 points against Florida A&M, hit the winning layup against St. Francis, and has been their most consistent closer all season, and CJ Hines, who provides secondary scoring punch and handles in crunch time. Antonio Madlock contributes with double-double production and veteran poise as the coach's son, while Micah Simpson offers a three-point threat off the bench. The Hornets are scrappy and resilient rather than dominant \u2014 they rarely blow teams out and almost never build comfortable leads, but they compete hard to the final buzzer. Defensively, they capitalize on opponent turnovers (St. Francis committed 15, leading to 26 Alabama State points), and they play with evident energy on neutral sites, going deep in the SWAC Tournament in Atlanta before advancing in Dayton. However, there is no evidence they can compete with the size, depth, or athleticism of a No. 1 seed like Auburn \u2014 who already dismantled far more talented opponents all season \u2014 and their non-conference record against high-major programs was an unambiguous 0-7. **Alabama State's realistic tournament ceiling is a first-round exit against Auburn**: they have earned enormous credit for winning the First Four in iconic fashion, but a 16-seed facing the No. 1 overall seed with this non-conference profile has almost no path to an upset, and the Hornets' tendency to play from behind against elite competition will be punished at a level they have not come close to handling all year.",

      "2025-03-18 - Alabama State: 70 vs St. Francis (PA): 68\n\nDAYTON, Ohio -- \u2014 Amarr Knox's layup with a second left lifted Alabama State to its first NCAA Tournament win Tuesday night, 70-68 over Saint Francis (PA) in a matchup of No. 16 seeds at the First Four. Knox scored 16 points to help the Hornets (20-15) earn a date with No. 1 overall seed Auburn on Thursday in a South Region game at Lexington, Kentucky. \u201cYou just said it: March Madness,\u201d said Alabama State coach Tony Madlock. \u201cI think I\u2019ve talked about this with all of the media, that all of our games end just like this, either we have to get a bucket or we have to get a stop. Fortunately enough we were able to get a bucket to finish this game off.\u201d After forcing a turnover in the final seconds, Alabama State had the ball out of bounds under its own basket. With the score tied, Micah Simpson threw a long pass nearly the length of the court toward a scrum of players in the lane at the other end \u2014 not unlike a Hail Mary in football. The ball deflected off a teammate and right into Knox's hands near the rim, giving him a simple layup for the winning points. \u201cWe put our tallest athletic person to go get the ball,\u201d Knox said. \u201cAnd fortunately everybody tipped the ball, and it landed to me, and I got the rebound and made the layup.\u201d Saint Francis chose not to pressure Simpson on the inbounds pass. Officials determined there was 1 second remaining after Knox\u2019s layup, but a desperation heave by the Red Flash fell short. Saint Francis, which lost its season opener at Dayton, made an unlikely return to the arena as the 19th team to enter the NCAA Tournament with a losing record. Those teams are now 0-19. \u201cThese guys for 34 games left it all out on the court for us,\u201d coach Rob Krimmel said. \u201cI know that they\u2019re disappointed. That\u2019s the thing that I love about them. They\u2019re champions, and nothing can take that away from our group.\u201d Alabama State is making its fifth NCAA Tournament appearance. Micah Octave\u2019s steal and dunk put the Hornets ahead by four with 1:36 left, but the Red Flash tied the score at 68 on Chris Moncrief\u2019s 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining. Juan Cranford Jr., playing in his hometown, led Saint Francis with 18 points. Valentino Pinedo scored 17 for the Red Flash (16-18), who squandered a nine-point lead. Saint Francis shot 59% and went 6 of 12 from 3-point range to take a 39-34 lead into halftime. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in that moment, that situation, a few times this year, and we knew we just had to come out and play ball,\u201d Knox said. \u201cWe stayed positive. We knew as soon as the next half started that we would come out, fly around, play aggressive and just do whatever it takes to win the game.\u201d The Red Flash committed 15 turnovers, leading to 26 points for the Hornets. \u201cWe turned the ball over too many times,\u201d Cranford said. \u201cWe turned the ball over that many times, you can\u2019t expect to come out with a good outcome.\u201d Following a missed shot by Knox down the stretch, TJ Madlock was fouled scrambling for the rebound. He missed the front end of a 1-and-1, but Saint Francis committed a turnover at the other end, setting up the dramatic finish. Up next: Auburn. \u201cI\u2019ll figure that all out tonight,\u201d Tony Madlock said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to enjoy this tonight. We\u2019re going to have this bus ride, I guess a couple hours down the road to play in Lexington at Rupp Arena. How can you beat that?\u201d Seeing red Things didn\u2019t start out so well for Saint Francis. During player introductions, the officials asked several Red Flash players to remove their black undershirts. By rule, undershirts must be the same color as the jersey. Saint Francis wore red. Charity stripe Alabama State didn\u2019t attempt a free throw until there was 5:09 remaining. The Hornets went 1 of 4 from the line. ------ AP March Madness bracket: and coverage: Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here."

    "profile_summary": "St. Francis (PA) enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 16-seed with a 16-18 record \u2014 a losing mark that tells most of the story, though context matters. The Red Flash were thoroughly outclassed in non-conference play, suffering blowout losses to Power Conference programs including Dayton (87-57), Clemson (88-62), Penn State (92-62), and Maryland (111-57), going 0-4 against that tier of competition and never truly competing in those contests. Their season was largely a Northeast Conference survival act, and even there they struggled early, falling to 5-11 before finding some footing. Heading into the tournament, St. Francis won five of their final seven games by the close of the regular season, including a gutsy overtime win at Le Moyne behind Chris Moncrief's 25-point effort, an overtime home win over Chicago State with Riley Parker pouring in 22, and a victory over Wagner in the conference tournament before stunning Central Connecticut \u2014 the NEC's dominant team at 19-6 \u2014 46-43 in what appeared to be the conference championship to earn the automatic bid. That late-season surge demonstrated genuine resilience, but the margins were razor-thin throughout, reflecting a team that wins ugly rather than dominates. St. Francis is defined by late-game drama: they have been involved in an extraordinary number of games decided by a possession or two \u2014 winning on a free throw with a second left against Campbell, losing on a bank shot in double overtime to Wagner, and nearly pulling off a first-round upset before losing 70-68 on a full-court deflection layup with one second remaining against Alabama State in the First Four. The offensive engine runs through Riley Parker, who has been the team's most consistent performer down the stretch, and Valentino Pinedo, who scored 17 in the First Four game and has been a reliable double-figure presence; Juan Cranford Jr. led the team with 18 points in Dayton in his hometown but the Red Flash ultimately committed 15 turnovers \u2014 a recurring vulnerability \u2014 that Alabama State converted into 26 points, proving that error-prone ball security remains a fatal flaw under pressure. St. Francis has no wins against ranked opponents and was outscored by a combined 116 points across their four games against Power Conference programs, offering zero evidence they can compete with elite competition. Their tournament ceiling was the First Four, and they have now been eliminated \u2014 a predictable outcome for a team whose identity, while admirably scrappy and resilient, is built on surviving close games in a weak mid-major conference rather than any discernible advantage that translates to the national stage.",

      "2025-03-19 - San Diego State: 68 vs North Carolina: 95\n\nDAYTON, Ohio -- \u2014 RJ Davis and his North Carolina teammates certainly looked as though they belonged in the NCAA Tournament on Tuesday night. Davis scored 26 points and shot 6 of 6 from 3-point range to help the Tar Heels silence some skeptics with a dominant 95-68 victory over San Diego State in their First Four matchup. UNC was a controversial NCAA selection on Sunday, but the Tar Heels played like a team with something to prove. \u201cWe know we deserved to be here,\u201d junior guard Seth Trimble said. North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said his players were simply focused on the task at hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a weight on us to try to get into the NCAA Tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cMy communication with them is to focus on us. It\u2019s not the noise on the outside in terms of comments and critics. Focusing on our preparation, our practice and our play.\u201d Some hot shooting from long range didn't hurt. RJ Davis' six 3-pointers tied Caleb Love's program record for an NCAA Tournament game. Love had six against UCLA in 2022. Hubert Davis went 5 for 5 from deep against Eastern Michigan in 1991. \u201cAs a head coach, I don\u2019t know what it looks like to exist without him on the sideline and on the floor, and I don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d Hubert Davis said about RJ Davis. The 14 made 3-pointers were the most for North Carolina in an NCAA Tournament game. UNC drained 13 against Marquette in 2022. \u201cI know that we hit a record number of 3s here, but made shots come and go,\u201d Hubert Davis said. \u201cThe thing I was most proud of is we were getting steals and deflections, and I thought our defense was real good.\u201d Trimble had 16 points for the Tar Heels in a matchup of No. 11 seeds. They advanced to play No. 6 seed Mississippi in a South Region game Friday in Milwaukee. Nick Boyd and Wayne McKinney III each scored 12 for the Aztecs (21-10). North Carolina shot 61% in the first half and went 7 of 9 from 3-point range. RJ Davis' long 3 just before the halftime buzzer gave the Tar Heels their largest lead to that point, 47-23. \u201cI think we did a good job of sticking to our game plan and playing Carolina basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got out in transition, we shared the ball.\u201d North Carolina (23-13) seemed a long shot to make the tournament with a 1-12 record in Quadrant 1 games, but was chosen Sunday thanks to a strong nonconference schedule and other metrics. The Tar Heels were out to show the world they belonged, and San Diego State took the brunt of it. \u201cObviously, we wish we\u2019d have given them more of a game,\u201d Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. \u201cWe hang our hat on our defense, and we couldn\u2019t get stops. We knew we had to play in the 70s to have a chance, and they were up in the 90s.\u201d Unstoppable San Diego State led the nation in field goal percentage defense, but had no answer for the Tar Heels. It was the most points the Aztecs allowed all season. The previous high was 80 in a loss to then-No. 3 Gonzaga on Nov. 18. North Carolina shot 52.6% from the field, and 58.3% from 3-point range. \u201cWe know who we are on the offensive end,\u201d Trimble said. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re capable of. This doesn\u2019t surprise me, what we did tonight. It\u2019s what I expect every single night.\u201d Extra work Despite not knowing whether they were in or out, the Tar Heels practiced on Sunday, hours before the tournament selection show, and prepared to play. \u201cYeah, we practiced on Sunday and then when we got here, and because of flight delays, this was the only practice that we had,\u201d Hubert Davis said. \u201cBut it was a really good 40-minute practice. Look, we\u2019ve had 98 practices and 35 games. We knew what we needed to do.\u201d ------ AP March Madness bracket: and coverage: Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "profile_summary": "San Diego State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a 21-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on defensive tenacity and hard-fought wins, but undermined by a troubling inability to consistently compete with elite competition. The Aztecs' most impressive moments came early, when they upset then-No. 21 Creighton 71-53 in Las Vegas behind BJ Davis's career-high 18 points and a suffocating defensive effort that forced 33.8% shooting, and when they edged No. 6 Houston 73-70 in overtime on Miles Byrd's two clutch free throws with 13 seconds left in regulation. Against ranked opponents overall, SDSU went a modest 3-5: wins over Creighton, Houston, and Colorado State were offset by losses to No. 3 Gonzaga (80-67), Oregon, UNLV (twice), and a blowout exit at New Mexico. Their final five games told a story of a team grinding to survive rather than surging: they beat Wyoming 72-69, lost to UNLV 74-67 in Las Vegas despite 19 points from Nick Boyd and a monster 15-10-6-4-3 line from Byrd, closed the regular season with a comfortable 80-61 home win over Nevada, and then were bounced in the Mountain West quarterfinals by Boise State 62-52 \u2014 a team they had beaten twice during conference play. Their First Four matchup against North Carolina ended in a 95-68 demolition, the most points San Diego State allowed all season, with UNC shooting 52.6% from the field and 58.3% from three; the Aztecs, who led the nation in field goal percentage defense, had no answer whatsoever.\n\nSan Diego State's identity is a defensive grind \u2014 they win ugly, they win close, and they rely on composure in clutch moments rather than offensive firepower. Wayne McKinney III's buzzer-beating layup in overtime at Air Force and Byrd's steady two-way play (including a 15-point, 10-rebound, 6-assist, 4-steal, 3-block line against UNLV) reflect a roster that competes hard and rarely folds, but the offense is too inconsistent and too dependent on individual nights from Boyd, Byrd, or Magoon Gwath \u2014 the 7-foot freshman who flashed genuine upside with a 25-point, 10-rebound career game at Fresno State \u2014 to sustain deep tournament runs. The team is notably stronger at home (wins over Houston, Boise State twice, New Mexico, Fresno State twice) and vulnerable on the road and at neutral sites, going 3-5 away from Viejas Arena in conference play. The UNC blowout is the definitive red flag: when elite shooting teams attack them with pace and three-point volume, SDSU's defensive system breaks down completely, and they have no offensive ceiling to compensate. **Verdict: San Diego State has already been eliminated** \u2014 their First Four loss to North Carolina ended their 2025 tournament run. Had they advanced, the evidence suggests a team capable of a scrappy second-round upset but not equipped for a Sweet 16 run, given their offensive limitations and demonstrable vulnerability against elite, shot-making opponents.",

      "2024-11-09 - Kansas: 92 vs North Carolina: 89\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 Hunter Dickinson had 20 points for top-ranked Kansas, which blew a 20-point first-half lead against No. 9 North Carolina before holding on for a 92-89 victory when the Tar Heels\u2019 Elliot Cadeau missed a 3-pointer as time expired Friday night. Zeke Mayo had 21 points and KJ Adams Jr had 14 for the Jayhawks (2-0), who led 49-29 in the first half but trailed 87-83 with 3:28 to go. Dickinson and Mayo responded with a series of baskets to tie the game at 89, and Dickinson\u2019s basket with 1:15 to go and free throw with 12 seconds remaining made it a three-point game. The Tar Heels (1-1) raced up the floor, but Cadeau\u2019s 3 from the wing never had a chance. Seth Trimble scored 19 points to lead North Carolina. RJ Davis had 16 points and Cadeau finished with 12. It was just the 13th matchup of the Tar Heels and Jayhawks, and the first since Kansas rallied from a 16-point deficit to win the 2022 national championship. The only other time they have met on campus was in 1960, when Larry Brown \u2014 who would later coach the Jayhawks to the 1988 title \u2014 helped the Tar Heels win in Allen Fieldhouse. Kansas made a repeat seem unlikely when it built a 20-point first-half lead. But the Tar Heels trimmed the deficit in the second half, and Jae'Lyn Withers' 3-pointer gave them an 80-79 lead with 7:06 to go. The two bluebloods wrestled it away several other times before Kansas finally put the game away. Takeaways North Carolina stayed alive by getting to the basket and drawing fouls, ultimately going 28 of 31 from the line. Kansas avoided what would have been the biggest blown-lead loss in school history while giving coach Bill Self his 590th win at the school, matching Phog Allen's record. Key moment Dickinson's basket inside with 1:15 left gave Kansas the lead, and the All-American center's free throw forced North Carolina into needing a 3-pointer to tie the game. Key stat 20 \u2014 The lead that Kansas had in the first half. And that the Tar Heels overcame in the second. Up next North Carolina plays American next Friday night.

      "2025-03-19 - San Diego State: 68 vs North Carolina: 95\n\nDAYTON, Ohio -- \u2014 RJ Davis and his North Carolina teammates certainly looked as though they belonged in the NCAA Tournament on Tuesday night. Davis scored 26 points and shot 6 of 6 from 3-point range to help the Tar Heels silence some skeptics with a dominant 95-68 victory over San Diego State in their First Four matchup. UNC was a controversial NCAA selection on Sunday, but the Tar Heels played like a team with something to prove. \u201cWe know we deserved to be here,\u201d junior guard Seth Trimble said. North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said his players were simply focused on the task at hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a weight on us to try to get into the NCAA Tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cMy communication with them is to focus on us. It\u2019s not the noise on the outside in terms of comments and critics. Focusing on our preparation, our practice and our play.\u201d Some hot shooting from long range didn't hurt. RJ Davis' six 3-pointers tied Caleb Love's program record for an NCAA Tournament game. Love had six against UCLA in 2022. Hubert Davis went 5 for 5 from deep against Eastern Michigan in 1991. \u201cAs a head coach, I don\u2019t know what it looks like to exist without him on the sideline and on the floor, and I don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d Hubert Davis said about RJ Davis. The 14 made 3-pointers were the most for North Carolina in an NCAA Tournament game. UNC drained 13 against Marquette in 2022. \u201cI know that we hit a record number of 3s here, but made shots come and go,\u201d Hubert Davis said. \u201cThe thing I was most proud of is we were getting steals and deflections, and I thought our defense was real good.\u201d Trimble had 16 points for the Tar Heels in a matchup of No. 11 seeds. They advanced to play No. 6 seed Mississippi in a South Region game Friday in Milwaukee. Nick Boyd and Wayne McKinney III each scored 12 for the Aztecs (21-10). North Carolina shot 61% in the first half and went 7 of 9 from 3-point range. RJ Davis' long 3 just before the halftime buzzer gave the Tar Heels their largest lead to that point, 47-23. \u201cI think we did a good job of sticking to our game plan and playing Carolina basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got out in transition, we shared the ball.\u201d North Carolina (23-13) seemed a long shot to make the tournament with a 1-12 record in Quadrant 1 games, but was chosen Sunday thanks to a strong nonconference schedule and other metrics. The Tar Heels were out to show the world they belonged, and San Diego State took the brunt of it. \u201cObviously, we wish we\u2019d have given them more of a game,\u201d Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. \u201cWe hang our hat on our defense, and we couldn\u2019t get stops. We knew we had to play in the 70s to have a chance, and they were up in the 90s.\u201d Unstoppable San Diego State led the nation in field goal percentage defense, but had no answer for the Tar Heels. It was the most points the Aztecs allowed all season. The previous high was 80 in a loss to then-No. 3 Gonzaga on Nov. 18. North Carolina shot 52.6% from the field, and 58.3% from 3-point range. \u201cWe know who we are on the offensive end,\u201d Trimble said. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re capable of. This doesn\u2019t surprise me, what we did tonight. It\u2019s what I expect every single night.\u201d Extra work Despite not knowing whether they were in or out, the Tar Heels practiced on Sunday, hours before the tournament selection show, and prepared to play. \u201cYeah, we practiced on Sunday and then when we got here, and because of flight delays, this was the only practice that we had,\u201d Hubert Davis said. \u201cBut it was a really good 40-minute practice. Look, we\u2019ve had 98 practices and 35 games. We knew what we needed to do.\u201d ------ AP March Madness bracket: and coverage: Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "profile_summary": "North Carolina enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a 23-14 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on resilience and late-season momentum rather than consistent excellence. The Tar Heels finished the regular season on a six-game winning streak before going 2-1 in the ACC Tournament, including a gutsy 68-59 win over Wake Forest and a near-miraculous comeback against Duke that fell agonizingly short 74-71 when Ven-Allen Lubin missed the front end of a crucial free throw and Jae'Lyn Withers stepped in the lane too early on the ensuing attempt. Their five-game closing stretch tells a compelling story: wins over NC State (97-73), Miami (92-73), Virginia Tech (91-59), and Wake Forest in the ACC Tournament, sandwiched around a narrow 82-69 loss to No. 2 Duke in the regular-season finale \u2014 a game in which they trailed by 15 at halftime but showed real fight before Duke pulled away late. Against ranked opponents across the full season, the Tar Heels struggled considerably, going approximately 3-12: their wins came over No. 18 UCLA (76-74 at MSG), No. 21 UCLA adjacent wins, and tournament-tested opponents, while suffering losses to No. 1 Kansas, No. 4 Auburn, No. 10 Alabama, No. 7 Florida, No. 23 Clemson, and Duke three times \u2014 a brutal Quadrant 1 record that nearly cost them their tournament bid. The defining identity of this North Carolina team is comeback artistry bordering on addiction: they erased 21-point deficits against Dayton and UCLA, rallied from 24 down against Duke in the ACC semis, and consistently spotted opponents large first-half leads before mounting second-half charges \u2014 a pattern that is simultaneously inspiring and deeply concerning against elite tournament competition. The engine of this team is fifth-year senior RJ Davis, who proved his tournament credentials immediately by shooting 6-of-6 from three and dropping 26 points in their First Four demolition of San Diego State (95-68), while freshman Ian Jackson has emerged as a genuine secondary star, scoring 20-plus points in multiple straight games at one point mid-season. Jae'Lyn Withers has been a critical third option down the stretch \u2014 he torched Notre Dame for seven 3-pointers in the ACC Tournament opener \u2014 and Ven-Allen Lubin provides a physical interior presence with back-to-back double-doubles late in the season. The Tar Heels are notably better at home (strong) and on neutral sites (competitive) than on the road, where they were blown out at Clemson (85-65) and struggled at Pittsburgh, though their MSG win over UCLA and the dominant First Four performance in Dayton suggest they embrace the neutral-site tournament stage. The First Four blowout of San Diego State \u2014 a team that led the nation in field-goal percentage defense \u2014 was a genuine statement, with North Carolina shooting 52.6% from the field and 58.3% from three, and the locker room energy postgame radiated a team with a chip on its shoulder after being a controversial selection. The realistic ceiling for this North Carolina team is the Sweet 16: Davis and Jackson give them enough individual firepower to knock off a higher seed or two riding momentum, their comeback DNA makes them dangerous in close games, and their neutral-site comfort suits March perfectly \u2014 but their chronic first-half holes, shaky free-throw shooting in critical moments, and a 3-12 record against ranked opponents over the full season reveal a team that has not yet demonstrated the sustained forty-minute dominance needed to reach an Elite Eight against genuinely elite competition.",

    "profile_summary": "Mount St. Mary's enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 16-seed with a 23-13 record, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built almost entirely within the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference with very limited success against power-conference competition. Against quality opponents outside the MAAC, the Mountaineers were handled decisively \u2014 blowout losses to Maryland (86-52) and Georgetown (79-51) early in the season revealed significant gaps against high-major talent, and a defeat at George Mason further underscored the ceiling. The lone marquee win of the season was a remarkable overtime upset at Miami (78-74) in December, where Mount St. Mary's erased a 10-point halftime deficit by shooting 50% from the field and going 9-of-11 from the free-throw line in overtime \u2014 an impressive moment of resilience, though Miami was just 4-8 at the time and struggling badly. Against ranked opponents, the Mountaineers appear to be 0-2 or worse, with no wins over teams receiving significant national recognition, making their tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9 thin by any meaningful metric. Recent form, however, tells a more encouraging story: over their final five games in the provided summaries \u2014 wins over Marist (62-52 regular season, 62-58 MAAC quarterfinal), Merrimack (57-55), and Iona (63-49) in the conference tournament, sandwiched around a loss at Quinnipiac (70-79) \u2014 the Mountaineers have won four of five and are clearly peaking at the right time. The MAAC Tournament run was particularly impressive, as the 6-seed knocked off the 3-seed (Marist), 2-seed (Merrimack), and 4-seed (Iona) in succession, winning three games in three days with gritty, low-scoring defensive performances and clutch free-throw shooting down the stretch.\n\nStylistically, Mount St. Mary's is a scrappy, resilient team that wins ugly and thrives in close games rather than blowing opponents out \u2014 their season is littered with one-and-two possession finishes, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer from Carmelo Pacheco to beat Niagara (84-83) and a come-from-behind overtime win at Miami. They are, however, dangerously inconsistent: a 34-point blowout loss to Quinnipiac (91-57) in January followed by competitive games in both directions illustrates a team that can either show up or completely disappear depending on the night. The offensive engine runs through Dola Adebayo, who routinely delivers 15-20 point, double-double efforts and is their most reliable two-way presence, while Dallas Hobbs, Terrell Ard Jr., Jedy Cordilia, and Carmelo Pacheco provide complementary scoring that can be streaky from three. Ard is particularly dangerous as a physical, attacking guard who shoots well from the free-throw line and creates off the dribble. Location-wise, the Mountaineers were reasonably competent at home but struggled notably on the road against better competition, and their neutral-site MAAC Tournament performance \u2014 three straight wins in Atlantic City \u2014 is the most encouraging sign entering the NCAA field. Nevertheless, as a 16-seed facing an opponent with a dramatically higher talent ceiling, Mount St. Mary's realistic tournament ceiling is a first-round exit; they are a gritty, well-coached mid-major that earned their bid and will compete, but lack the athleticism, depth, and big-game r\u00e9sum\u00e9 required to pull off one of college basketball's rarest upsets.",

    "profile_summary": "Texas enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a 19-16 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built almost entirely on survival rather than dominance, and one that reflects the brutal reality of a first-year SEC schedule that included early-season gauntlets against Auburn, Tennessee, Florida, and Alabama. Against ranked opponents, the Longhorns went a modest 4-11: notable wins include a come-from-behind 70-69 home victory over #13 Texas A&M (erasing a 22-point second-half deficit), an 82-78 upset of #15 Kentucky, a 61-53 win over #22 Missouri, and a 77-73 road win at Oklahoma when the Sooners were ranked \u2014 but the losses include beatdowns from #2 Auburn (87-82), #1 Tennessee (74-70), #5 Florida (84-60), #2 Alabama (103-80), and #23 Ole Miss (72-69), painting the picture of a team that is competitive but not elite against top-tier competition. Their final five games tell a story of maddening inconsistency: a gutty overtime win at #25 Mississippi State (87-82), a home loss to Oklahoma in the regular season finale (76-72), then three straight tournament wins over Vanderbilt (79-72), Texas A&M in double overtime (94-88), and a quarterfinal loss to #8 Tennessee (83-72) \u2014 playing their third game in three days \u2014 leaving them 3-1 in Nashville with momentum that is real but earned against an exhausted schedule. In terms of style, Texas is a comeback team that thrives in chaos: they are rarely dominant wire-to-wire and have shown a tendency to spot opponents large leads before mounting scrappy, frenetic rallies, which is both their greatest strength and most alarming vulnerability. The engine of everything is freshman guard Tre Johnson, who is playing at a genuinely spectacular level \u2014 he set a program freshman record with 39 points at Arkansas, had 30 against Texas A&M in the regular season comeback, and has been the team's closer in multiple pressure moments; however, he has also gone quiet in critical stretches, including late against Tennessee twice and in a poor shooting night against Syracuse early in the year. Arthur Kaluma (34 points vs. Auburn, consistent double-doubles) and Tramon Mark (24 points vs. Mississippi State, 19 vs. Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament) provide important secondary firepower, though Kaluma has been hampered by a left knee issue that caused him to miss games in February \u2014 his availability and health entering the tournament must be monitored closely. Texas is notably stronger on neutral courts than on the road: they went 5-1 at neutral sites (winning the UKG Legends Classic and going 3-1 in Nashville) compared to a shaky road record that includes blowout losses at Florida and South Carolina, suggesting the neutral NCAA Tournament setting may actually suit them. The Longhorns carry a scrappy, never-quit identity \u2014 the A&M double-overtime win on a Johnson go-ahead three and Shedrick's buzzer-forcing dunk in OT1 is a defining moment \u2014 but they are also collapse-prone and give up big leads and absorb big runs with alarming regularity, which could be fatal against a disciplined tournament opponent. **Verdict:** Texas is a dangerous but flawed 11-seed \u2014 capable of pulling off a first-round upset on the strength of Johnson's star power and their resilient comeback identity, but unlikely to advance deep into the bracket given their inconsistency against elite competition, ongoing injury concerns, and a tendency to wilt in the final minutes of close games; a realistic ceiling here is the Round of 32, with a Sweet 16 appearance possible only if Johnson is playing at his peak and Kaluma is healthy.",

    "profile_summary": "Xavier enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a 22-12 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reads as genuinely competitive within a strong Big East but defined by an uneven first half and a spectacular late surge. Against ranked opponents, the Musketeers went 4-7: quality wins include a road victory at then-No. 7 Marquette (59-57), a home win over No. 19 UConn (76-72), and a regular-season win over No. 22 South Carolina (75-66), while losses came to Michigan, Cincinnati, UConn (in overtime), Marquette (twice), and St. John's (twice) \u2014 a mixed but respectable body of evidence against elite competition. Xavier's recent form is the most compelling part of their case: they won seven straight to close the regular season, with wins over Creighton (83-61), Butler (91-78), and Providence (76-68) by comfortable margins before falling 89-87 to Marquette in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals on Ryan Conwell's career-high 38-point performance \u2014 a game they led by 14 in the second half before collapsing down the stretch, a recurring vulnerability that cannot be ignored. Zach Freemantle is the team's engine, a bruising presence who returned from a knee injury suffered in December and has been exceptional lately, posting 23, 24, and 25 points in the final three regular-season games; his ability to score in the paint and on the glass gives Xavier a legitimate interior weapon at the tournament level. The Musketeers play a multi-layered offensive style \u2014 capable of exploding from three (11-of-23 in the Big East Tournament), grinding through free throws, and generating points in the paint \u2014 but they are dangerously collapse-prone, having blown double-digit leads against both St. John's (lost in OT after leading by 16) and Marquette in the Big East quarterfinals. Locationally, Xavier is notably stronger at home (where they beat UConn and Marquette during their seven-game streak) and has struggled on the road and at neutral sites, going just 1-4 away from Cincinnati against ranked opponents. The Musketeers carry the energy of a team that has found its identity late \u2014 Conwell's clutch scoring, Freemantle's interior dominance, and Dailyn Swain's versatile playmaking give them legitimate star power \u2014 but their tendency to surrender large leads and accumulate turnovers under pressure (19 against Michigan, a near-collapse against South Carolina State) suggests a team that can beat anyone on a given night and also beat itself. **Verdict: Xavier is a dangerous first-round opponent and a realistic Sweet 16 threat \u2014 their late-season momentum, balanced scoring, and ranked-game experience make them capable of a second-round upset, but their lead-protection issues and road/neutral-site inconsistency make a run beyond the Sweet 16 a significant ask.**",

      "2025-03-08 - Louisville: 68 vs Stanford: 48\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- \u2014 Terrence Edwards Jr. and Chucky Hepburn scored 16 points apiece, and No. 14 Louisville ended the regular season Saturday with a 68-48 victory over Stanford. The Cardinals (25-6, 18-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) used their defense to earn their ninth straight victory and 19th in 20 games. Stanford went nearly eight minutes between baskets, missing 11 shots in a row. That allowed Louisville to go on a 14-1 run and take a 29-11 lead after Hepburn's layup with 5:04 left before halftime. J\u2019Vonne Hadley added 11 points and nine rebounds for the Cardinals, who played without starting guard and third-leading scorer Reyne Smith (ankle). Maxime Raynaud recorded his 23rd double-double for the Cardinal (19-12, 11-9), scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. Takeaways Stanford: The Cardinal's drought led to a season-low 18 points in the first half, and the 48 points was their worst performance this season. Louisville: The 2024-25 Cardinals matched the victory total the program amassed over the previous three seasons. Key moment With 32.5 seconds left on Senior Day, Hepburn, Edwards, Noah Waterman, Aboubacar Traore and Frank Anselem-Ibe were subbed out for their final time at the KFC Yum Center and received a standing ovation. Hepburn kissed the court to show his appreciation. Key stat Three days after holding California to just 29.6% shooting, Louisville held the Cardinal to 30.4% from the floor. Aside from the season-opening win against Morehead State (23.1%), those are the best defensive performances of the season. Up next Both teams advance to next week\u2019s ACC Tournament in Charlotte. Stanford will begin play in the second round on Tuesday, and Louisville starts in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-13 - Louisville: 75 vs Stanford: 73\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Chucky Hepburn\u2019s putback jumper at the buzzer helped No. 13 Louisville overcome a 15-point second-half deficit to beat Stanford 75-73 on Thursday night and advance to the semifinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament. Terrence Edwards scored 25 points and Hepburn added 20 for the Cardinals (26-6), who\u2019ve won 10 straight. Noah Waterman and James Scott each had 12. Oziyah Sellers had 22 points and Maxime Raynaud added 17 points for Stanford (20-13), which was playing in its first ACC Tournament. Stanford led 33-30 at halftime and appeared ready to pull away in the second half, building a 52-37 lead in the second half behind an 11-0 run. But Raynaud picked up his fourth foul with 13 1/2 minutes left and Louisville capitalized, battling back to take the lead 70-65 with three minutes remaining after Hepburn knocked down a 3 and then fed J'Vonne Hadley for a layup. Raynaud fouled out on the ensuing possession, but Stanford tied the game on Chisom Okpara's three-point play with 32 seconds left. Edwards missed a 3-pointer, but as players collapsed for the rebound the ball bounced out directly to Hepburn, who caught it and buried a 15-footer for the win. Takeaways Stanford: Raynaud picking up his fourth foul early in the second half was a huge turning point, as Louisville turned the momentum of the game. Louisville: The Cardinals played without guard Reyne Smith, their third-leading scorer at 13.4 points per games, due to an ankle injury. Smith's absence seemed to impact Louisville's chemistry, particularly in the first half. Key moment There was no bigger moment than Hepburn's putback at the buzzer. Key stat Louisville outrebounded Stanford 32-28. Up next Louisville will face No. 10 Clemson in the semifinals. Stanford is likely headed to the NIT. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-03-15 - Louisville: 76 vs Clemson: 73\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Terrence Edwards scored 21 points, J\u2019Vonne Hadley added 20 points and nine rebounds and No. 13 Louisville beat No. 10 Clemson 76-73 on Friday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament semifinals. Chucky Hepburn, the hero of Louisville\u2019s dramatic 75-73 quarterfinal win over Stanford, added 12 points for the Cardinals (27-6). Chase Hunter had 23 points for Clemson (27-6), while Ian Schieffelin had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Louisville is seeking its first ACC title on Saturday night, but No. 1 Duke, which held on to beat North Carolina 74-71 in the other semifinal, stands in its way. The Cardinals held Clemson without a field goal for more than six minutes in the second half to built a 67-52 lead with 3:50 left. But the Tigers cut their deficit to two with 54 seconds remaining on a layup from Hunter, who had 19 second-half points. After Louisville was called for a shot-clock violation, Clemson had the ball and chance to tie or take the lead. But James Scott blocked Hunter's drive after switching off his man. Hepburn made 1 of 2 free throws with 6 seconds left to make a three-point game and Hunter's leaning 3-point shot from 25 feet at the buzzer missed. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers showed toughness battling back late in the fourth quarter and could prove to be a tough out in the NCAA Tournament. Louisville: The Cardinals may have shown a vulnerability as the Tigers were able to turn them over repeatedly with a full court press down the stretch. Key moment Scott's block on Hunter's layup was the game's biggest play, although Clemson was left screaming for a foul. Key stat There were 41 fouls called in the game. Up next Clemson will await seed in the NCAA Tournament. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

    "profile_summary": "Louisville enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 8-seed with a 27-8 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that dramatically outpaces expectations for a program that went 8-24 just one season ago under a completely overhauled roster. Against ranked opponents, the Cardinals went 4-7: notable wins include a dominant 89-61 demolition of then-No. 14 Indiana in the Battle 4 Atlantis (scoring 52 second-half points at 66.7% shooting), a commanding 98-73 road win over No. 25 SMU, and victories over North Carolina and Clemson in the ACC Tournament; losses came against No. 12 Tennessee (by 22), No. 23 Ole Miss (by 23), No. 9 Duke (twice \u2014 once in December by 11 and again in the ACC Championship 73-62), and No. 5 Kentucky (by 8). Over their final five games, Louisville went 4-1: a 85-68 win over California, a 68-48 defensive shutdown of Stanford to close the regular season, then a stunning buzzer-beater comeback from 15 down to beat Stanford 75-73 in the ACC quarterfinals, a 76-73 semifinal win over No. 10 Clemson, and a 73-62 loss to No. 1 Duke in the ACC Championship \u2014 a game in which they were without key contributor Reyne Smith (ankle). That final stretch reveals both the Cardinals' ceiling and their vulnerability: capable of dramatic, resilient performances against quality opposition, but ultimately unable to close against truly elite competition. Louisville's style is built around guard play, perimeter shooting, and relentless pressure defense \u2014 they regularly force 20-plus turnovers per game and convert them into transition points, and they shoot a high volume of threes, with Smith (100 3-pointers this season, a program-era record), Chucky Hepburn, and Terrence Edwards Jr. capable of getting scorching hot on any given night. Hepburn is the unquestioned engine: the Wisconsin transfer posted a career-high 37 points against Pitt, delivered a buzzer-beating putback jumper to stun Stanford in the ACC quarterfinals, and has repeatedly delivered in clutch moments, though he can be streaky from the field and the Cardinals are noticeably diminished when he struggles. Edwards has emerged as a legitimate star, scoring a career-high 35 against California and providing playmaking (10 assists vs. Miami) alongside scoring; Hadley provides a physical interior presence with multiple double-doubles; and Smith, when healthy, is one of the ACC's elite perimeter weapons. However, Smith's ankle injury is a legitimate concern \u2014 Louisville was a demonstrably different team without him, struggling with chemistry in ACC Tournament play and failing to cover the offensive void. The Cardinals carry genuine big-game experience: they survived a near-collapse against Stanford, gutted out a narrow overtime win over West Virginia, and beat Clemson twice \u2014 but they have also been blown out by Tennessee and Ole Miss, collapsed at Georgia Tech after leading by 13, and needed a career performance from Hepburn to hold off a struggling Virginia Tech team late in February. Louisville is 9-3 in road and neutral-site games, which is genuinely impressive and suggests they will not be intimidated by the tournament environment; their nine road wins are a program highlight and their neutral-site record (Battle 4 Atlantis, ACC Tournament) reflects a team that rises in high-stakes moments. First-year coach Pat Kelsey has instilled a confident, competitive identity in a program that was a bottom-feeder one year ago, and this team carries itself with resilience \u2014 they do not quit, as evidenced by the Stanford comeback and multiple second-half surges \u2014 but they are also turnover-prone against elite pressure defenses and can go cold from three for extended stretches, as seen against Tennessee and Duke. **Tournament ceiling: Sweet 16.** Louisville is dangerous enough as an 8-seed to knock off a 1-seed \u2014 their perimeter firepower, turnover-forcing defense, and Hepburn's clutch gene make them a legitimate threat in any single game \u2014 but their inability to sustain performance against top-15 competition, Smith's injury cloud, and a thin bench make a run to the Elite Eight or beyond an unlikely outcome absent a favorable bracket path.",

      "2025-03-15 - St. John's: 82 vs Creighton: 66\n\nNEW YORK -- \u2014 Regular-season champs. A tournament title. Pride in the program fully restored. The pied piper of college basketball rebuilds, Rick Pitino has St. John's back atop the Big East. And this time, the nets were coming down. RJ Luis Jr. scored all but two of his 29 points after halftime and No. 6 St. John's made 14 straight shots from the field in the second half to beat Creighton 82-66 on Saturday night for its first Big East Tournament title in 25 years. \u201cWow, this is incredible just to come from last year to this year and to see the transformation,\u201d Luis said. \u201cCoach P is the mastermind behind all of this. I mean, it\u2019s truly special.\u201d Zuby Ejiofor added 20 points and Kadary Richmond had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the top-seeded Red Storm (30-4), who reached 30 wins for the third time in program history before a roaring hometown crowd at sold-out Madison Square Garden. They earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for their first trip since 2019, making the 72-year-old Pitino the first coach to take six schools to the Big Dance. The others were Boston University, Providence, Kentucky, Louisville and Iona. \u201cGreat win for the city. Great win for our university. You hear it all along that it\u2019s New York\u2019s team, and it truly is,\u201d the Hall of Fame coach said. \u201cAs a New Yorker myself, I\u2019m very, very proud that St. John\u2019s has gotten to this level.\u201d Pitino, in his second season with the Johnnies, also became the first coach to win the Big East Tournament at two schools. He\u2019s won three times in his last four seasons in the league, after guiding Louisville to championships in 2009, 2012 and 2013. \u201cI saved the best for last,\u201d Pitino announced to loud cheers from the crowd of 19,812, pausing to remove falling confetti from his lips during a postgame interview on the court. Luis, the Big East Player of the Year, also grabbed 10 rebounds and was selected the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He was draped in a Dominican Republic flag as fans chanted \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d after the game. \u201cJust still trying to soak it in, and it\u2019s just crazy how much you can speak things into existence and just watch it all come together,\u201d Luis said. \u201cThis has by far been the most emotional, happiest week of my 22 years of existence.\u201d Ejiofor and Richmond made the All-Tournament team. \u201cThe three of them have been unstoppable,\u201d Pitino said. Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 15 points for second-seeded Creighton (24-10), which fell to 0-5 in Big East championship games since joining the conference for the 2013-14 season. \u201cIt's hard to get to this game, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d coach Greg McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to be here quite a few times. Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t been able to finish the job.\u201d When the resurgent Johnnies clinched their first outright regular-season conference championship in 40 years with a victory over Seton Hall at The Garden on March 1, they had already decided not to cut down the nets to celebrate. More work to do. But on this night, players and staff climbed the ladder and snipped their souvenirs. It was the fourth Big East Tournament title for the Johnnies, who made the championship game for the first time since winning the 2000 trophy under Mike Jarvis. The previous two came in the 1980s under Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca, who died Nov. 30 about five weeks shy of his 100th birthday. \u201cTo finally get over the hump, it\u2019s really an unbelievable feeling,\u201d Ejiofor said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be a part of history.\u201d And after the Red Storm cut down the nets, a message appeared on the giant video screen above center court: \u201cFor Looie.\" \u201cI\u2019m thinking he would be so proud of this team,\u201d said Pitino, who has quickly revived St. John's into a national power again late in his illustrious but checkered career. \u201cHumility is a big part of my life right now. It wasn\u2019t always that way,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in redemption. I believe in humility.\u201d The drought between Big East Tournament titles for the Johnnies was the longest for any team in league history. \u201cSt. John\u2019s didn\u2019t get built by the NIL. St. John\u2019s got built with character of the players,\" Pitino said. Luis was whistled for his second foul with 7:19 left before halftime and sat out the rest of the half. After falling behind by eight early, St. John\u2019s finally took its first lead at 43-41 with 11:55 remaining when backup big man Vince Iwuchukwu scored left-handed in the post over the 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner, the four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. That came 33 seconds after Ejiofor converted a tying three-point play that began a streak of 14 consecutive made field goals in 7:12 for the Red Storm, giving them a 70-55 lead. They connected on 17 of their final 19 field goal attempts to finish at 72% in the second period (23 for 32). Quite an offensive display for a team that entered the game shooting 45% from floor. \u201cWe definitely fed off the crowd, the energy, the atmosphere,\" Luis said. \u201cIt was ridiculous. It was very loud.\u201d By the numbers St. John\u2019s has won nine straight games, and 19 of 20 since the new year. The team finished 21-0 on its home courts, including 12-0 at MSG \u2014 the program\u2019s most wins at The Garden since compiling 13 in 1958-59. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season. Creighton injury Bluejays reserve Fedor Zugic injured his right ankle with 11:23 left in the first half and had to be helped off the court to the locker room. He didn\u2019t return. Key stat Creighton, which entered shooting 74% on free throws, missed six of its first eight from the line and finished 8 for 16. Up next Creighton: Headed to its fifth straight NCAA Tournament when the brackets are revealed Sunday. St. John\u2019s: Hasn\u2019t won an NCAA Tournament game in 25 years. Pitino and the streaking Red Storm seem likely to receive a No. 2 seed Sunday. \u201cWe still have a lot to prove. We\u2019re not done,\u201d Ejiofor said. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and"

    "profile_summary": "Creighton enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 9-seed with a 25-11 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a team capable of genuine excellence but haunted by troubling inconsistency at the worst moments. The Bluejays' best wins are legitimately impressive: an upset of No. 1 Kansas 76-63 in Omaha behind Pop Isaacs' 27-point explosion, a road win at UConn that snapped the Huskies' 28-game home winning streak, and a second win over Marquette 77-67 that briefly made Creighton look like a Big East title contender. Against ranked opponents, Creighton went approximately 6-8, with signature neutral-site losses to San Diego State and Texas A&M in November, road losses to Alabama and St. John's, and back-to-back home losses to UConn and St. John's that ended a nine-game winning streak in February. In the Big East Tournament, the Bluejays beat DePaul and upset No. 3 UConn 71-62 \u2014 with Jasen Green and Jamiya Neal combining for 38 points \u2014 before getting routed 82-66 by St. John's in the championship game, a loss that exposed their vulnerability when a hot offense goes cold at the free-throw line (8-of-16) against elite opposition. Creighton's final five games produced a 3-2 record: wins over DePaul and Seton Hall by comfortable margins, a bad 22-point blowout loss at Xavier, then the Big East semifinal win over UConn and the championship game defeat \u2014 a pattern that perfectly summarizes their season-long identity as a team that can beat anyone but can also lose to anyone.\n\nThe engine of this Creighton team is Ryan Kalkbrenner, the 7-foot-1 Big East Defensive Player of the Year who has been dominant all season \u2014 posting 35 points and 12 rebounds at Providence, 29 points against Xavier, and 27 with 15 rebounds in the regular-season finale against Butler \u2014 and Steven Ashworth, a deadly three-point shooter who hit the game-winning three at Villanova with seven seconds left and erupted for six threes against Marquette. Jamiya Neal has emerged as a genuine third option, and Jasen Green's breakout Big East semifinal performance (8-of-10 from the field, 19 points) adds intrigue entering March. The Bluejays play a high-scoring, three-point-dependent style \u2014 they are electric when the threes fall, as evidenced by Ashworth's six-three explosion against Marquette, but painfully flat when they don't, shooting 26.7% from three in the St. John's loss and 28.6% in the regular-season loss to Nebraska. Injury concerns linger: Kalkbrenner missed time with a lower-body injury in early December, took a hit to his right foot late in the St. John's regular-season loss, and reserve Fedor Zugic injured his ankle in the Big East final and did not return. Location-wise, Creighton is strong at home (where they upset Kansas and UConn) but markedly inconsistent on the road and neutral sites, going 0-2 in the Players Era Festival and absorbing ugly losses at Georgetown and Xavier. At their best \u2014 Kalkbrenner dominating the post, Ashworth and Neal raining threes, the bench contributing \u2014 this team has the talent and big-game experience to reach the Sweet 16, but their three-point volatility, demonstrated vulnerability against physical, aggressive opponents, and tendency to go flat in second halves against elite defenses make a run deeper than the Sweet 16 a difficult case to make. **Ceiling: Sweet 16 \u2014 a genuinely dangerous 9-seed capable of pulling a first-round upset, but too streaky and three-point-dependent to be trusted against elite tournament competition beyond that.**",

      "2024-11-09 - Purdue: 72 vs Northern Kentucky: 50\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- \u2014 Fletcher Loyer scored 16 points and Trey Kaufman-Renn had 14 to lead No. 14 Purdue to a 72-50 rout of Northern Kentucky on Friday night. Braden Smith added 11 points and seven assists for the Boilermakers (2-0). Caleb Furst scored eight off the bench. No one reached double figures for the Norse (0-2). Trey Robinson, Sam Vinson and Keeyan Itejere each had eight points. The Boilermakers used a 12-0 spurt to take an 18-4 lead in the opening half. However, a nearly six-minute scoring drought kept Purdue from pulling away early. The Boilermakers settled for a 37-24 halftime lead. In the first minute of the game, Purdue freshman center Daniel Jacobsen, who scored 13 points in the season opener, fell and needed to be helped to the bench. He was able to walk to the locker room and returned to the bench with ice on his shin, but did not play again. Boilermakers coach Matt Painter said Jacobsen sustained a lower leg injury and will have an MRI on Saturday. Takeaways Northern Kentucky: The Norse shot just 30% from the field. They did manage to tie Purdue with 33 rebounds each. Northern Kentucky had a 15-8 edge in offensive boards. Purdue: The Boilermakers did a better job of finishing off an overmatched opponent than they did in a 90-73 victory against Texas A&M Corpus Christi. Purdue\u2019s lead was narrowed to three points late in that game. Purdue was helped by shooting 50% from the field, but was just 9 of 14 at the free-throw line. Key moment Freshman guard Gicarri Harris sank a pull-up jumper in the paint as the shot clock expired to fire up the crowd and give Purdue a 60-40 lead. That started an 8-0 run. Key Stat Loyer shot 4 of 5 from 3-point range as Purdue made 9 of 22 attempts from long range. Northern Kentucky went 5 for 23, with two of those makes coming late in the game.

      "2024-11-12 - Purdue: 92 vs Yale: 84\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- \u2014 Braden Smith finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and six assists Monday night and Trey Kaufman-Renn added 17 points to lead No. 13 Purdue past Yale 92-84. The Boilermakers (3-0) extended their home winning streak to 21, tying the third-longest in Mackey Arena history. They've also won 24 consecutive November games and still have not lost a regular-season non-conference game since December 2020. John Poulakidas scored 23 points and made five 3-pointers to lead Yale (1-2). Samson Aletan had a career high 14 points and seven rebounds for the defending Ivy League champs. Purdue played without 7-foot-4 freshman Daniel Jacobsen, who fractured his right tibia in his second career start Friday. He is scheduled to have surgery Wednesday and could miss the rest of this season. The Boilermakers student section also was on its best behavior Monday after university officials threatened to remove anyone who repeated Friday's chant about firing football coach Ryan Walters. Takeaways Yale: The Bulldogs managed to withstand Purdue's size and speed, but the perimeter struggles were costly. Eventually, Yale ran out of gas. But this is a team that could win another conference crown. Purdue: Coach Matt Painter's squad continues to dominate the season's first month, even against potential NCAA Tournament teams. The Boilermakers must play much cleaner basketball when they face tougher foes, a challenge that begins in this weekend. Key moment Camden Heide made two 3s, forced a turnover and saw his effort to snag an offensive rebound lead to a missed layup for Yale. Smith used that miss to set up a dunk by Myles Colvin that gave Purdue a 72-60 lead with 7:30 to go. Key stat Yale actually won the scoring battle in the paint 50-24 but went 8 for 26 on 3s while the Boilermakers were 11 for 23.

Cox scored nine of his 11 points during a game-turning 13-0 run midway through the second half to help No. 13 Purdue get past No. 2 Alabama 87-78 on Friday night. The Boilermakers (4-0) have won 21 consecutive home games and 25 straight in November. They have not lost a regular-season nonconference game since December 2020. Braden Smith had 17 points and 10 assists as he moved into third place on Purdue's career assists list with 483. Fletcher Loyer also scored 17. Alabama (3-1) was led by freshman Labaron Philon, who had a season-high 18 points off the bench before fouling out with 2:02 to play. Grant Nelson added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Mark Sears scored 15 in a matchup between two of last season's Final Four teams. Takeaways Alabama: Coach Nate Oats rolled the dice playing such an early road game against a team so traditionally strong at home, especially in November. But the Crimson Tide learned lessons that will help them in the long run. Purdue: The Boilermakers might have turned the corner. After three straight rocky performances, coach Matt Painter\u2019s squad delivered its best game yet. If Purdue continues playing this way, it could be the Big Ten contender everyone expects. Key moment After Alabama took its largest lead at 65-59, Kaufman-Renn answered with a basket and Cox made three straight 3-pointers to fuel a 13-0 run that gave the Boilermakers a 72-65 advantage with 8:17 to play.

Roddy Gayle Jr. scored 14 for the Wolverines (19-5, 11-2 Big Ten) while Tre Donaldson and Vladimir Goldin scored 12 apiece. The Boilermakers (19-6, 11-3) were led by Braden Smith with a game-high 24 points, Trey Kaufman-Renn with 22 points and Fletcher Loyer with 15. Michigan trailed most of the night, rallying from a 48-38 deficit with 14:44 remaining with a 19-9 run to tie it on a 3-pointer by Nimari Burnett with 5:51 to go. Neither team led by more than four the rest of the way. The Boilermakers dominated for most of the game, but Michigan kept coming back and trailed 37-35 at the half.

      "2025-02-15 - Purdue: 84 vs Wisconsin: 94\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- \u2014 John Tonje scored 22 of his 32 points in the second half Saturday and Max Klesmit added 17 points and six assists to help No. 16 Wisconsin beat No. 7 Purdue 94-84. Tonje scored 10 straight points during a key second-half stretch that gave Wisconsin a lead it never relinquished. The Badgers (20-5, 10-4) won their fourth straight despite losing backup guard Kamari McGee late in the first half when a replay review resulted in a Flagrant 2 call and an ejection after McGee's hand hit Trey Kaufman-Renn below the waist as he tried to guard Purdue's Braden Smith. Kaufman-Renn led Purdue with a career high 30 points. Fletcher Loyer scored 15 and Smith had 12 assists C.J. for the Boilermakers (19-7, 11-4), who lost their second straight for the second time this season. Purdue honored All-American forward Caleb Swanigan at halftime. The 2017 Big Ten Player of the Year and first-round draft pick of the Portland Trail Blazers died in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2022 at age 25. The local coroner ruled Swanigan died from natural causes. Takeaways Wisconsin: After a sluggish start, the Badgers showed what they're capable of by nearly outscoring Purdue in the first half and playing much better defense in the second. Purdue: The Boilermakers struggled to find a second scoring option in the second half when Kaufman-Renn had 21 of Purdue's 47 points. The result: A rare second home loss. Key Moment Tonje's four-point play with 15:47 left in the game not only gave the Badgers their first lead since 16-14, it spurred an 11-0 run that put Wisconsin in control for the rest of the game. Key Stats Wisconsin made 18 of 25 shots and 6 of 12 3s without turning the ball over in the second half. Up next The Badgers begin a three-game homestand Tuesday against Illinois.

The Spartans (21-5, 12-3 Big Ten) have won three of four to pull within a half-game of conference-leading and 12th-ranked Michigan, heading into the rivals' matchup on Friday night at Crisler Center. Trey Kaufmann-Renn scored 24 and Braden Smith added 17 for the defending Big Ten-champion Boilermakers (19-8, 11-5), who have lost three straight for the first time in five years. Michigan State's Coen Carr and Jaden Akins each scored 10 points. The Boilermakers led by seven midway through the first half and the Spartans went on a surge to take a 33-31 lead at halftime. Michigan State stayed in control in the second half and sealed the win by finishing 4 for 4 from the field. Takeaways Purdue: Without 7-foot-4 Zach Edey, now a rookie with the Memphis Grizzlies, the Boilermakers can't protect the rim and the Spartans took advantage with lobs and dunks. Michigan State: No one picked coach Tom Izzo's team to win the Big Ten title before the season started, but the balanced and streaky squad has a shot with two games left against Michigan and a home game against No. 11 Wisconsin. Key moment Coen Carr defied gravity with a dunk off a high lob to tie the score late in the first half during a 16-5 run that gave the Spartans control. Key stat Michigan State scored 19 points off Purdue's 12 turnovers. Up next With first place in the Big Ten at stake, Michigan State will play at Michigan on Friday night.

      "2025-02-23 - Indiana: 73 vs Purdue: 58\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- \u2014 Malik Reneau and Trey Galloway each scored 15 points, and Indiana allowed just 21 in the second half to overcome a 12-point halftime deficit and beat No. 13 Purdue 73-58 on Sunday. Reneau also had six rebounds and was 7 of 7 from the field as he joined the 1,000-point club. Galloway added nine assists as the Hoosiers (16-11, 7-9 Big Ten) won for the second time in eight games and earned a split in the season series with their biggest rival. Fletcher Loyer scored 20 points to lead the Boilermakers (19-9, 11-6), who have lost four straight. It was quite a reversal for Indiana. The Boilermakers appeared to take control by closing the first half on a 21-4 run to make it 37-25. But the Hoosiers opened the second half on a 14-2 spurt, tying the score at 39, and then scored 14 straight to take a 53-40 lead with 11:56 to go. Takeaways Purdue: This loss likely ends the quest for a third straight regular-season league title, and now coach Matt Painter must find a quick solution heading into the postseason. Indiana: Coach Mike Woodson is on his way out, but the Hoosiers are trying to play their way into the NCAA Tournament. Their win two weeks ago at No. 11 Michigan State certainly helped and so will this one. While there's work to do, Indiana may have righted its season. Key moment Indiana took the lead for good when Anthony Leal grabbed a loose ball underneath the basket, preventing a turnover. He found Luke Goode, who made a layup and drew a foul before completing the three-point play for a 42-40 lead with 14:39 left.

Takeaways UCLA: The Bruins had the edge in bench scoring at 30-8, but had trouble slowing down Purdue\u2019s top scorers. Purdue: With his third assist, Smith became Purdue\u2019s all-time assist leader with 691, passing Bruce Parkinson (1973-77). Smith finished with eight assists. Key moment With the shot clock winding down, Loyer hit a 3-pointer to give Purdue a 67-56 led. The home crowd erupted and UCLA called a timeout with 3:38 left.

Smith picked up his fourth foul with 8:20 left but was able to sit the rest of the way thanks to Purdue\u2019s large lead. He finished with nine assists. Key moment After grabbing a rebound, Smith passed to Furst for an alley-oop dunk off a fast break to make it 42-37 with 3:36 left in the first half. That started a 7-0 run, which included a 3-pointer by Smith and a second-chance driving layup by C.J. Cox.

Illinois (20-11, 12-8 Big Ten) trailed 63-53 with 11:34 to go, but outscored the Boilermakers 13-1 in the final two minutes to win its third in a row after losing three straight. Will Riley led five Illinois players in double figures with 22 points. Tre White had 20 points and nine rebounds, and Jakucionis had 10 points and seven assists. Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 29 points for Purdue (21-10, 13-7) and Braden Smith had 18 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, falling just short of the second triple-double in team history. Takeaways Illinois: The Illini joined Gonzaga, Houston and San Diego State as the only teams in the country to have at least 20 regular-season wins in each of the last six years. Purdue: Smith is among the favorites for Big Ten Player of the Year. Kaufman-Renn, the team\u2019s leading scorer, also deserves consideration because he's the Boilermakers' only inside threat. Key moment Riley made a 3-pointer at the first-half buzzer to end a personal seven-point run and get Illinois within 42-40. Key stat The teams combined for 32 3-pointers in their previous game, with the Boilermakers making 18.

      "2025-03-14 - Purdue: 76 vs USC: 71\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Trey Kaufman-Renn matched a career high with 30 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 28 seconds left, and No. 20 Purdue scored the final five points to beat Southern California 76-71 on Thursday night in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. The sixth-seeded Boilermakers (22-10) trailed by 10 points in the first half, but they tied it by halftime and emerged from a back-and-forth second half thanks largely to Kaufman-Renn, who finished 12 of 20 from the field and 6 of 11 from the free-throw line. Purdue advanced to face No. 22 and second-seeded Michigan in Friday\u2019s quarterfinals. The teams split this season, with each winning at home. With USC (16-17) trailing by three in the closing seconds, Desmond Claude turned the ball over before the Trojans could attempt a tying 3-pointer. Big Ten Player of the Year Braden Smith made two free throws to finish the scoring with 3.6 seconds remaining. Smith had 12 points on 3-of-10 shooting and nine assists. Claude led the Trojans with 18 points. Wesley Yates added 13. Takeaways USC: The Trojans have the athletic skill and length to match up with most teams and pushed Purdue despite having played a double-overtime game the night before. On talent alone, this team should get an NIT bid. Purdue: Despite struggling to defend taller, quicker players in the backcourt, the Boilermakers did just enough in the final moments. They had lost five of their previous seven. Key moment Kaufman-Renn made a layup with 5:14 left to tie the game at 67-all, and Purdue never trailed gain. Key stat Purdue made 15 of 23 free throws.

      "2025-03-15 - Michigan: 86 vs Purdue: 68\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Danny Wolf had 18 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, and No. 22 Michigan snapped a three-game losing streak with a 86-68 win over No. 20 Purdue Friday in a Big Ten Tournament quarterfinal. The second-seeded Wolverines (23-9) allowed the game's initial six points, then led for the final 37 minutes in an impressive bounce-back win to advance to a semifinal against No. 11 Maryland (25-7) on Saturday. Eight Michigan players scored at least six points. Vladislav Goldin added 15 points and eight rebounds. Tre Donaldson had 13 points and Roddy Gayle Jr. scored 11. Trey Kaufman-Renn led sixth-seeded Purdue (22-11) with 24 points and nine rebounds. Big Ten player of the year Braden Smith, who averaged 24 points and 8.5 assists in two regular-season meetings vs. Michigan, finished with 12 points on 5-of-18 shooting, 2 of 10 from 3-point range. He had six assists. Takeaways Purdue: The Boilermakers have a strong 1-2 offensive punch in Kaufman-Renn and Smith, but NCAA Tournament survival likely hinges on the supporting cast, which is capable but often inconsistent. Michigan: A much-needed confidence boost for the Wolverines after a lackluster regular-season finish. When this team shares the ball (25 assists) and limits turnovers (six), it's a tough out. Key moment Michigan opened the second half with a 12-5 spurt to build a 52-41 lead after a Donaldson 3-pointer.

    "profile_summary": "Purdue enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 4-seed with a 24-12 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine Big Ten relevance but also real vulnerability against elite competition. Against ranked opponents, the Boilermakers went roughly 7-9, with notable wins over then-No. 2 Alabama (87-78), No. 23 Ole Miss on a buzzer-beating putback, No. 13 Oregon on the road, and USC and NC State in neutral-site tournament play, but with damaging losses to No. 2 Auburn (87-69, blown out by 18 at halftime), No. 15 Marquette (76-58, 15 turnovers), No. 16 Wisconsin (94-84 at home), and No. 14 Michigan State (75-66) during a brutal four-game losing skid in February. That late-season collapse \u2014 four straight losses to Indiana, Michigan State, Wisconsin, and Michigan \u2014 is the defining blemish on their tournament profile, and while Purdue did recover with wins over UCLA and Rutgers to close the regular season, they were then beaten soundly by Michigan 86-68 in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals, with Braden Smith going just 5-of-18 from the field and 2-of-10 from three. Entering the tournament, Purdue's last five results read: win over UCLA (76-66), win over Rutgers (100-71), loss at Illinois (88-80 on a late collapse after leading by 10), win over USC in the Big Ten Tournament (76-71), and loss to Michigan (86-68) \u2014 a sequence that screams inconsistency rather than momentum. The Boilermakers are built around a genuinely elite 1-2 punch in Trey Kaufman-Renn (averaging over 20 points in recent weeks, including back-to-back 29-30 point efforts) and Big Ten Player of the Year Braden Smith, who is one of the most complete guards in college basketball when locked in \u2014 capable of 30-point, 12-assist, near-triple-double nights \u2014 but who has been alarmingly streaky in big moments, shooting 3-of-14 in the Ohio State loss and 5-of-18 against Michigan in the conference tournament. The supporting cast of Fletcher Loyer, Camden Heide, C.J. Cox, and Myles Colvin provides enough shooting and depth to be dangerous on a given night \u2014 Cox erupted for 23 on 9-of-11 shooting against Nebraska, and Loyer and Smith combined for 46 points and 14 threes against Rutgers \u2014 but this bench has been a persistent weak point, famously contributing zero points in the loss at Michigan. Purdue is emphatically a home team: they won 26 consecutive home games during the season and dominated teams like Nebraska (104-68) and Michigan (91-64) at Mackey Arena, but went just 3-5 in true road games and have shown a troubling tendency to go flat away from home, including a 16-turnover first half at Penn State, a 15-turnover meltdown at Marquette, and a second-half collapse at Illinois. On neutral sites, the Boilermakers are battle-tested \u2014 they won the Rady Children's Invitational with a dramatic buzzer-beating win over Ole Miss and beat NC State in a Final Four rematch \u2014 but the Michigan beatdown in Indianapolis raises real concerns about whether they can execute under tournament pressure when Smith struggles. The team's identity is paradoxical: capable of wire-to-wire dominance (the 91-64 Michigan blowout, the 104-68 Nebraska demolition) but equally capable of catastrophic collapses, having blown a 16-point lead to Ohio State and coughing up a 10-point second-half lead at Illinois in the final two minutes. Purdue has the star power and big-game experience to be a legitimate threat through the first weekend, and Kaufman-Renn's interior dominance gives them a size advantage against most opponents, but the turnover issues (48 turnovers in three games at one point), Smith's inconsistency in elimination settings, and the absence of a reliable rim protector since losing 7-foot-4 freshman Daniel Jacobsen to a fractured tibia in November are all real concerns at this level. The realistic ceiling for this Purdue team is the Sweet 16: their frontcourt talent and offensive",

    "profile_summary": "High Point enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 13-seed with an impressive 29-6 record, having won the Big South Conference Tournament as the top seed. The Panthers' r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is built almost entirely on mid-major and lower-tier competition \u2014 their notable non-conference wins include UAB (68-65), North Texas (76-71), and Southern Illinois (94-81), but they dropped games to Missouri State, UNC Greensboro, Norfolk State, and UNC Asheville during the regular season, raising real questions about how their game translates against Power Conference-level athleticism and depth. Against quality opponents, High Point has shown the ability to compete but has also been vulnerable to teams with a clear offensive focal point \u2014 Missouri State's Vincent Brady (27 points, 10 rebounds) and Norfolk State's Brian Moore Jr. (33 points) both dismantled them individually. Their conference tournament run, however, was commanding: a 21-point win over Gardner-Webb, a gutty 76-73 semifinal win over Radford that featured a decisive 12-2 second-half run, and a championship victory over Winthrop to close out what became a 12-game winning streak entering March Madness \u2014 a streak that speaks to genuine momentum and cohesion at the right time of year.\n\nThe Panthers are a multi-threat offensive team that can win in multiple ways, making them a legitimate threat to cause trouble in the first round. Kezza Giffa is their engine \u2014 efficient, composed, and capable of 20-plus-point performances (25 in the conference tournament quarterfinals, 23 against Old Dominion, 22 against Charleston Southern), and he shows a particular knack for drawing fouls and converting at the line. Kimani Hamilton is a physical force who can go for 18-21 points while crashing the boards at an elite level, as demonstrated by his 18-point, 15-rebound performance against Norfolk State. D'Maurian Williams is the playmaking heartbeat of the offense \u2014 a shifty, penetration-first guard who can facilitate and score (24 points against Southern Illinois, 20 against Presbyterian) \u2014 while Chase Johnston provides a genuine three-point weapon off the bench or in spot roles. Stylistically, High Point wins through multi-ball-handler ball movement, capable perimeter shooting, and second-half adjustments \u2014 their 11-0 second-half run to erase a nine-point deficit against Old Dominion and their 12-2 run in the conference semifinal both illustrate a team that is mentally resilient and capable of responding to adversity. However, they are not a dominant wire-to-wire team \u2014 they trailed at halftime in multiple games and have shown a vulnerability against physical opponents who can post a go-to scorer. Locationally, High Point has gone 4-3 in road and neutral-site games against meaningful competition, suggesting they are not overwhelmed by hostile environments but are not bulletproof away from home either. Realistically, this is a dangerous, well-coached mid-major riding a 12-game winning streak with multiple reliable scorers and a battle-tested identity \u2014 a quintessential first-round upset threat. Their ceiling is a second-round appearance: capable of knocking off a 4-or-5-seed opponent in the opening round, but unlikely to sustain a deep run against the kind of elite athleticism and depth that characterizes top-four seeds in the second weekend.",

      "2025-03-13 - Wisconsin: 70 vs Northwestern: 63\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Nolan Winter and John Tonje each scored 18 points to lead No. 18 Wisconsin to a 70-63 victory over Northwestern in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament on Thursday. The Badgers (24-8), seeded fifth, will face No. 4 seed UCLA in Friday\u2019s quarterfinals. Winter hit 4 of 5 shots and 9 of 10 free throws. Nick Martinelli led the No. 13 seed Wildcats (17-16) with 22 points. Jordan Clayton added 10 points. Leading by eight points, Wisconsin\u2019s Max Klesmit hit a 3-pointer to push the lead to 53-42. Kamari McGee followed that with a 3-pointer to push the lead to 56-42 with 8:58 remaining. Two more 3-pointers by Tonje gave the Badgers a 62-46 edge. The Badgers shot 41.5% from the field while holding the Wildcats to 37%. Free throws were nearly even with the Wildcats making 18 of 22 while the Badgers were 18 of 23. Wisconsin held a 37-30 lead at halftime. Takeaways Northwestern: Trailing by as many as 18 points in the second half, the Wildcats kept fighting down the stretch to narrow the final deficit. The Wildcats closed the game with a 12-2 run. Wisconsin: The Badgers shot better in the second half and committed only 10 turnovers. Wisconsin had a 17-5 edge in points off turnovers. Key moment Leading 50-42, Klesmit\u2019s 3-pointer started a 14-4 run that increased the lead to 64-46. Key stat After going 3 of 12 from 3-point range in the first half, Wisconsin sank 5 of 13 3-pointers in the second half, including four in a row in a key stretch. Up next Northwestern coach Chris Collins said his team is too beat up physically and decided as a team not to accept an NIT or College Basketball Crown bid. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-14 - UCLA: 70 vs Wisconsin: 86\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 John Tonje matched his career high with six 3-pointers on his way to 26 points, and No. 18 Wisconsin tied the Big Ten Tournament single-game record by making 19 3s in an 86-70 victory over fourth-seeded UCLA on Friday. Tonje also had nine rebounds and four assists. He was 9 of 10 from the field and a perfect 6 for 6 on 3s as the Badgers (25-8) advanced to Saturday's first semifinal game against No. 7 Michigan State. John Blackwell added 18 points, five rebounds and four assists while making four 3s. Six Badgers made at least one shot from beyond the arc. Iowa also made 19 3s against Northwestern three years ago. Sebastian Mack scored 18 points for the Bruins (22-10), who head into the NCAA Tournament with a 4-4 mark in their last eight games. Kobe Johnson had 14 points. Wisconsin seized control by closing the first half with a flurry of 3s to build a 48-29 cushion. Takeaways Wisconsin: Coach Greg Gard's revamped offense certainly has paid dividends this season, and it was never more evident than during Friday's shooting display. Now comes the bigger test: winning a third game in three days, this time against a top-10 foe. UCLA: It was a miserable first Big Ten tourney game for the Bruins. They shot 32.4% from the field, couldn't defend the 3-point line and spent most of the day staring at double-digit deficits. Now UCLA will find out if this loss damages its NCAA seeding. Key moment Wisconsin turned a competitive game into a blowout by making five consecutive 3s during the decisive 15-7 run late in the first half. Key stat Wisconsin made 12 3-pointers in the first half while UCLA had only 11 total baskets. Up next The Badgers will try to even the season series against the Spartans after losing in East Lansing on March 2. The Bruins head home to get their NCAA Tournament draw. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-03-15 - Michigan State: 74 vs Wisconsin: 77\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 John Tonje scored 32 points and grabbed seven rebounds to help No. 18 Wisconsin beat No. 7 Michigan State 77-74 on Saturday in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament. John Blackwell added 14 points as the Badgers (26-8) won for the third time in four days. They will play No. 22 Michigan for the tournament title on Sunday. The Wolverines beat No. 11 Maryland 81-80 on a last-second layup. Jase Richardson had 21 points and seven rebounds for the Spartans (27-6). Jeremy Fears Jr. had 14 points and six assists, but he had the ball knocked away in the waning seconds as he tried to tie the score with a heave from near the midcourt logo. Michigan State, the league's regular-season champs, had won eight in a row. Wisconsin erased a 45-41 deficit with an 11-0 run in the second half. The Badgers were pushed to the very end, but they used four straight points to make it 72-67 with 1:10 to play. Takeaways Wisconsin: The Badgers followed an 86-point game with 19 3-pointers by showing they could win a grind-it-out game, too. Tonje could make Wisconsin a sneaky Final Four pick. Michigan State: The Spartans were rolling until Saturday. Could this loss cost the Spartans a No. 2 seed for the NCAA tourney? Maybe. But getting an extra day off might help more. Key moment After Tonje missed a 3-pointer with 34 seconds left, Blackwell tried to chase down the rebound, but his path was impeded by Jaden Akins, who was called for the foul. Blackwell made both free throws to give the Badgers a 74-70 lead with 31.4 seconds to go. Key stat The Badgers made three more free throws than Michigan State, 22-19. Up next Wisconsin will play No. 22 Michigan on Sunday and try to win its first Big Ten tourney title since 2015 and claim the league\u2019s automatic NCAA Tournament bid. The Spartans will find out their tourney fate Sunday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

    "profile_summary": "Wisconsin enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 3-seed with a 27-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that features marquee wins, maddening inconsistency, and a late-season identity built around one of the country's most explosive offensive players. Against ranked opponents, the Badgers went an impressive 8-6: signature wins include a 103-88 dismantling of then-No. 9 Arizona at home, a 94-84 road win at then-No. 7 Purdue, back-to-back Big Ten Tournament victories over No. 4 UCLA (86-70) and No. 7 Michigan State (77-74), and a regular season sweep of Iowa \u2014 but losses to Marquette (by 14, with 16 turnovers), Michigan State (71-62 on the road), UCLA on the road (85-83), and Maryland (76-68) reveal a team that can be exposed by elite athleticism, perimeter shooting, or its own turnovers on a bad night. Recent form is genuinely compelling: Wisconsin won four of its final five games including three in three days at the Big Ten Tournament, knocking off UCLA and Michigan State before falling to Michigan 59-53 in the championship \u2014 a loss that carries more context than concern given the compressed schedule. Wisconsin's offensive identity is built on a historically elite free-throw attack (the nation's top percentage all season), a lethal three-point barrage (a program-record 21 threes against Iowa; 19 in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals), and a high-tempo half-court offense that has averaged 82 points per game and produced 15 games with at least 80 points \u2014 but the same team committed 17 turnovers in an overtime home loss to Oregon and has shown a troubling tendency to fall into early deficits, having trailed Holy Cross by 16, Pittsburgh by 14, and Ohio State by double digits at various points this season.\n\nThe engine of this team is graduate transfer John Tonje, who is playing at a genuinely elite level entering March: he scored 32 points against Purdue, 31 against Illinois, 32 and seven rebounds in the Big Ten semifinal win over Michigan State, and has now scored 30-plus points in consecutive tournament games while shooting at an extraordinary clip \u2014 9-of-10 from the field including a perfect 6-of-6 from three against UCLA. John Blackwell has been equally important as a sophomore, posting multiple 20-plus point efforts and contributing 18 points and four assists in the UCLA blowout, while Max Klesmit's return from a lower-leg injury (he missed three regular season games) gives Wisconsin a critical third perimeter weapon heading into the bracket. Nolan Winter provides veteran interior presence with double-doubles and reliable finishing, and Steven Crowl \u2014 despite six costly turnovers against Oregon \u2014 gives the Badgers a skilled 7-footer who shot a season-high 20 points against Illinois. Location matters for this group: the Badgers are notably stronger at home (losses to Michigan and Marquette on the road in December were early warning signs) but their neutral-site performance has been excellent, going 5-1 on neutral floors including the Greenbrier tournament title and three straight Big Ten Tournament wins. The team's energy reads as resilient and confident rather than composed \u2014 they have a clear capacity for dramatic runs (erasing 14-point deficits, winning three games in three days), but also a fragility when turnovers pile up or three-point shooting goes cold, as the 5-of-32 from deep against Michigan State in the regular season and the 59-53 Big Ten final loss to Michigan both demonstrate. With Tonje playing at an All-American level, an offense that can erupt for 19-21 threes on any given night, and proven experience beating top-ten opponents on neutral floors, Wisconsin is a legitimate Elite Eight threat and a credible Final Four dark horse \u2014 but a team this streaky from three, this dependent on Tonje, and this capable of self-destructing with turnovers is unlikely to be the last team standing; a realistic ceiling is the Elite Eight, with a path to the Final Four if Tonje stays hot and the three-point shooting holds.",

The 6-foot-10 Milicic also had two steals and made two 3-pointers. Money Williams led Montana (2-2) with 30 points. Takeaways Montana: Six of the Grizzlies\u2019 nine-man rotation are playing at Montana for the first time. That leaves for a pretty steep learning curve so early in the season, especially against the No. 11 team in the country. Tennessee: A week ago, Gardner-Webb scored 64 points in a loss to Tennessee. More than half (34) of those points came in the paint. That was a concern for Vols coach Rick Barnes. With an emphasis on defense down low, Tennessee allowed just 10 against Louisville but had a bit of a regression against Montana (22). Key moment A 13-2 run to start the second half allowed Tennessee to turn a nine-point halftime lead into an 18-point advantage that gave the Vols some breathing room. Chaz Lanier had eight of those points. Key stat Tennessee committed nine turnovers in the first half. The Vols had just one in the first 14 minutes of the second half and stretched the lead to 23. Up next Montana will play at Utah State on Monday, and Tennessee will take on Austin Peay on Sunday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

    "profile_summary": "Montana enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 14-seed with a 25-10 record \u2014 a Big Sky Conference co-champion that earned its automatic bid the hard way, winning the conference tournament over Northern Colorado 91-83 in the championship game. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9, however, carries a significant asterisk: against power-conference opposition early in the season, the Grizzlies were routed comprehensively. Oregon dismantled them 79-48 in November, Tennessee blew them out 92-57, Utah State handled them 95-83, and Northern Iowa put up 104 points in a 28-point blowout \u2014 a stretch that makes clear Montana is a mid-major program that has not demonstrated the ability to compete with high-major athleticism and depth. Against ranked opponents, Montana went 0-3 in games with detailed summaries (Oregon, Tennessee, Northern Iowa), losing by an average of roughly 25 points. The only meaningful competitive non-conference win of note was a home victory over South Dakota State, a solid Summit League program. What saves Montana's profile is what came after: the Grizzlies rattled off a 10-game winning streak through February, captured 15-3 Big Sky Conference regular-season marks, and closed the year by beating Northern Colorado in the conference championship \u2014 avenging an earlier 81-57 home blowout loss to the Bears in January. Their last five games (wins over Eastern Washington 83-72, Northern Arizona 74-65, Idaho 78-55, and Northern Colorado 91-83, sandwiched around an overtime road loss at Portland State 79-76) show a team playing with genuine confidence and building momentum at exactly the right time, though the Portland State slip \u2014 blowing a lead and losing in overtime \u2014 is a reminder that this team can still be had on the road.\n\nMontana's identity is a balanced, multi-contributor offensive attack without a single unstoppable star, which is both a strength and a limitation. Money Williams is the emotional engine and top scorer \u2014 his career-high 36-point performance in the Portland State overtime loss was stunning, and he has strung together several big games down the stretch \u2014 but he is a bench piece who can go quiet, as evidenced by just eight points in the Idaho State blowout loss in January. Joe Pridgen is a rugged, reliable interior force who routinely contributes double-doubles \u2014 21 points and 13 rebounds against Montana Tech, 20 and 13 against CSU Northridge \u2014 but he was not dominant in the conference tournament. Malik Moore is a streaky but capable three-point shooter, and Brandon Whitney, who holds Montana's all-time assist record, is the steady hand who controlled the Northern Arizona quarterfinal almost single-handedly with 24 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Kai Johnson adds athleticism and clutch playmaking \u2014 his late heroics against Utah Tech and his 23-point conference title performance demonstrate a composed, aggressive mindset. The Grizzlies play with resilience and scrappiness; they are rarely disengaged, tend to make games close, and have shown they can win ugly on the road (Weber State, Northern Arizona, Sacramento State). However, they are not a team that blows opponents out with superior talent \u2014 they grind, shoot threes, and rely on collective effort, which is a formula that tends to run into a wall against high-major athleticism. Montana's tournament ceiling is a first-round upset win if their three-point shooting (Patterson went 5-of-10 from deep against Idaho in the conference tournament) is clicking and the opponent underestimates them, but a second-round run is highly unlikely given their 0-3 record against power-conference opponents with losses by a combined 75+ points. **Verdict: Likely first-round exit; dangerous enough to steal a game if their perimeter shooting runs hot, but not equipped to advance past the Round of 32.**",

      "2025-03-09 - Baylor: 61 vs Houston: 65\n\nWACO, Texas -- \u2014 L.J. Cryer scored 23 points with six 3-pointers as Big 12 champion and third-ranked Houston won its 10th consecutive game, beating Baylor 65-61 on Saturday night to wrap up the regular season. J'Wan Roberts added 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Cougars (27-4, 19-1 Big 12), including two free throws with 13 seconds remaining. Milos Uzan had 12 points and Emanuel Sharp scored 11. The Cougars won without making a field goal after Sharp's 3-pointer for a 58-48 lead with 6:07 left. They have won a national-best 14 road games in a row, including a 10-0 mark in Big 12 play. Baylor (18-13, 10-10) led 29-26 at halftime and was up by seven before the Cougars used a 20-4 run to take the lead for good. Freshman guard VJ Edgecombe scored 23 points for the Bears, who have lost four of their last six games. Norchad Omier had 13 points and 16 rebounds, his 87th career double-double to match Tim Duncan\u2019s total at Wake Forest for the second-most in NCAA history. Tom Gola had 96 for La Salle in the 1950s. Takeaways Houston: The Cougars have at least 27 wins for the fifth season in a row under coach Kelvin Sampson. ... Roberts has 1,000 career rebounds and 1,000 points, joining Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon and Greg Anderson as the only Houston players to accomplish that feat. Baylor: The Bears didn\u2019t have a winning conference record for the first time since an 8-10 Big 12 mark in 2017-18. Key moment Ja\u2019Vier Francis' baseline dunk eight minutes into the second half gave Houston its first lead since the 8:08 mark of the first.

      "2025-03-13 - Houston: 77 vs Colorado: 68\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 Emanuel Sharpe scored 19 points before fouling out, and No. 2 Houston overcame an injury to veteran forward J'Wan Roberts in the second half to beat Colorado 77-68 on Thursday and advance to the semifinals of the Big 12 Tournament. LJ Cryer and Milos Uzan added 14 points apiece for the top-seeded Cougars (28-4), who will play No. 17 BYU \u2014 the No. 4 seed in the tournament \u2014 on Friday night for a spot in their second consecutive championship game. Houston's postseason run a year ago was derailed by injuries, so it made sense that the bench tensed up when Roberts went down right in front of it with about 18 minutes to go. The Cougars' leading rebounder was helped to the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a right ankle sprain, and Roberts spent the rest of the game watching from the bench. Andrej Jakimovski had 25 points for the Buffaloes (14-20), who won twice in the Big 12 tourney as its first No. 16 seed to finish a trying season on a high note. Leading scorer Julian Hammond III managed just nine points on 2-for-13 shooting. The Cougars, who lost in the Big 12 title game to Iowa State last year, have won 11 consecutive games since losing in overtime to Texas Tech on Feb. 1. That streak includes another win over the Buffaloes in early February. Takeaways Colorado lost forward Sebastian Rancik to an injury in the first half. And without another body off the bench, the grind of playing three games in three days was evident as Houston wore the Buffaloes down in the second half. Houston advanced to its seventh straight conference tournament semifinal. It won the American title in 2021 and '22. Key moment Colorado closed within 66-58 with 5 1/3 minutes left when Uzan hit a pair of 3-pointers to give the Cougars a cushion. Key stats Houston trailed for only 29 seconds in the game.

      "2025-03-14 - Houston: 74 vs BYU: 54\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 Emanuel Sharpe scored 26 points, LJ Cryer had 20 and second-ranked Houston stifled No. 17 BYU in a 74-54 victory Friday night that moved the Cougars into the Big 12 Tournament championship game for the second consecutive season. Milos Uzan added 14 points and Mylik Wilson pulled down 13 rebounds, helping the tournament's top seed jump to a big early lead and roll into Saturday night's matchup with Arizona on a 12-game win streak. Houston (29-4) played without J'Wan Roberts, its leading rebounder, after he sprained his ankle early in the second half of the Cougars' quarterfinal win over Colorado. Roberts watched from the bench with his right foot in a walking boot. He got to watch quite a defensive show by one of the nation's best. Houston forced BYU to miss its first nine shots, including seven from beyond the arc, where coach Kevin Young's team had set a Big 12 Tournament record with 18 made 3s on its way to 96 points in a quarterfinal win over Iowa State. That nearly seven-minute lull allowed Houston to roar to a 15-0 lead that it spent the rest of the game protecting. BYU trimmed its 40-21 halftime deficit to 13 midway through the second half but never threatened to come all the way back. Keba Keita had 14 points and 12 rebounds for BYU. Dawson Baker scored 11 points and Richie Saunders had 10. Takeaways BYU still has not won a conference tournament title since 2001 in the Mountain West. Houston lived up to its billing as the nation's No. 1 team in defensive efficiency. Key moment Sharpe converted a four-point play with 13:40 left in the first half to give Houston its 15-0 lead. Key stat Houston has beaten BYU by an average of 25.5 points in their two games this season.

    "profile_summary": "Houston enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a No. 1 seed with a 35-5 record and back-to-back outright Big 12 regular-season titles \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that places them firmly among the national title contenders. Against ranked opponents, the Cougars went an impressive 10-7, with marquee wins over No. 12 Kansas (twice), No. 13 Arizona on the road, No. 8 Iowa State, No. 10 West Virginia, and No. 9 Texas Tech in Lubbock to clinch the Big 12 crown \u2014 losses coming to Auburn, Alabama (OT), San Diego State (OT), Texas Tech (OT at home), and none by more than a handful of possessions. Their 14 consecutive road wins \u2014 including a perfect 10-0 mark in Big 12 road play \u2014 is the longest active streak in the nation and speaks volumes about their ability to perform in hostile environments; Houston is not a team that fades when it leaves home, where they also boasted a 33-game winning streak. The Cougars' identity is defined by suffocating defense \u2014 ranking as the nation's No. 1 team in defensive efficiency \u2014 relentless rebounding, and a turnover-forcing pressure system that routinely generates 20+ points off turnovers per game. They finish games, too: a 69-68 escape at UCF on J'Wan Roberts' layup with 1.1 seconds left, a double-overtime road win at Kansas, and a gutsy 62-58 win at Arizona late in the season all demonstrate a team that competes through adversity rather than wilting under it.\n\nEntering the tournament on a 13-game winning streak \u2014 closing with wins over BYU (74-54), Colorado (77-68), Arizona (72-64 in the Big 12 title game), Kansas (65-59), and Baylor (65-61) \u2014 Houston is playing its best basketball of the season and doing so while managing genuine injury concerns. J'Wan Roberts, their do-everything forward who recorded his 1,000th career rebound and is averaging double-figures, sprained his right ankle in the Big 12 quarterfinals and watched the final two tournament games from the bench in a walking boot; his status is a critical variable. Emanuel Sharp, their second-leading scorer, missed time with an ankle injury and has been in and out of the lineup, though he erupted for 26 points in the Big 12 semifinal win over BYU. When healthy, Houston's core \u2014 LJ Cryer (a dangerous scorer who hit a career-high 30 twice and is ice-cold in clutch moments), Milos Uzan (a do-it-all transfer averaging near-double-digits in assists with a career-high 22 points against Texas Tech), Roberts, Sharp, and Terrance Arceneaux off the bench \u2014 is as complete as any unit in the country. Their three overtime losses (Alabama, San Diego State, Texas Tech) all came against quality opponents and by a combined six points, suggesting their only vulnerability is foul trouble and free-throw execution in extended games, not a lack of fight. Houston's tournament ceiling is a national championship: this is an elite, experienced, deep, and battle-tested team with the best defense in the country, a proven ability to win everywhere, and the offensive firepower to go punch-for-punch with anyone \u2014 provided Roberts returns and the injury cloud clears.",

While Ole Miss clawed back some in the first half, Auburn was able to stay in front and put away the game after halftime. Key moments Auburn ran out to a 29-9 lead, which included a 6-of-7 start from 3-point range. Key stat Ole Miss turned the ball over 10 times to Auburn\u2019s eight, marking the first time all season the Rebels finished a game with more turnovers than their opponent.

      "2025-03-01 - Kentucky: 78 vs Auburn: 94\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. -- \u2014 Miles Kelly scored a season-high 30 points to lead No. 1 Auburn to a 94-78 win over No. 17 Kentucky on Saturday. The Tigers (27-2, 15-1 SEC) have six straight victories and won the SEC regular-season title outright when No. 5 Tennessee edged No. 6 Alabama 79-76 later Saturday. Auburn posted video on X of its players celebrating on the team bus after watching Tennessee's 3-pointer at the buzzer to win it. Auburn won in Lexington for the first time since a 53-52 triumph over then-No. 1 Kentucky in 1988. Chad Baker-Mazara followed Kelly with 22 points and Tahaad Pettiford scored 21. Koby Brea led Kentucky (19-10, 8-8) with 21 points. Andrew Carr had 20 points and Amari Williams had 13 points and 14 rebounds. Takeaways Auburn: Leading scorer Johni Broome (18.8 ppg) finished with just nine points and had just one in the first half. Auburn got its eighth win against a top-15 foe this season, including six against teams ranked in the top five. The Tigers remained undefeated (10-0) on the road against league opponents this season. Kentucky: The Wildcats were without third-leading scorer Jaxson Robinson (wrist). Coming off a career-high 28 points in an 83-82 win at Oklahoma on Wednesday, leading scorer Otega Oweh (16.1 ppg) scored four points, just the second time he\u2019s failed to reach double figures in 29 games this season. Kentucky made just four 3-pointers, compared to 12 for Auburn. Key moment Auburn gained control with a 14-2 run that turned a 7-6 advantage into a 21-8 lead with 12 minutes left in the first half. Auburn closed out the first half with an 11-2 spurt for a 49-34 halftime lead. Key stat The Wildcats committed 18 turnovers, with the Tigers scoring 21 points off those miscues. Kentucky had four straight turnovers in the first three minutes of the second half.

      "2025-03-05 - Texas A&M: 83 vs Auburn: 72\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- \u2014 Zhuric Phelps scored 19 points off the bench and No. 22 Texas A&M never trailed in an 83-72 win over top-ranked Auburn on Tuesday night. It\u2019s Texas A&M\u2019s first-ever win over a team ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll and ends a six-game winning streak for the Tigers, who clinched the Southeastern Conference title with a win over Kentucky on Saturday. Texas A&M (21-9, 10-7 SEC) denied Auburn (27-3, 15-2) an undefeated conference road record after the Tigers entered the game 9-0 in SEC road games this season. The Aggies, who snapped a season-long four-game skid, led by double digits for most of the night and were up 12 with about two minutes to go before Tahaad Pettiford made a 3-pointer to get Auburn within 79-70. But Phelps made two free throws to extend the lead. Pettiford made three 3-pointers in less than two minutes early in the second half to power a run that got the Tigers within six, but Wade Taylor IV had a three-point play that started a 5-0 run which pushed A&M\u2019s advantage to 62-51. Pettiford led Auburn with 19 points, including six 3-pointers. The Aggies got their first win since Feb. 15 against Arkansas in front of a rowdy crowd of 12,257 that included 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and Tampa Bay receiver Mike Evans, who starred at Texas A&M together. Takeaways Auburn: The Tigers were hurt by an off night from top scorer Johni Broome, who entered the game averaging 18.4 points but managed just eight. He left the game for a couple of minutes early in the first half with what appeared to be a shoulder injury but played 32 minutes despite the problem. Texas A&M: The Aggies rebounded from their recent struggles with the big win that should give them momentum entering the SEC tournament. Key moment The Aggies asserted their dominance from the beginning of this one, jumping out to a 12-2 lead and controlling the game throughout. Key stat Texas A&M, which entered the game leading the nation in offensive rebounding, had a 24-9 advantage.

      "2025-03-08 - Auburn: 91 vs Alabama: 93\n\nAUBURN, Ala. -- \u2014 Mark Sears hit a game-winning floater as time expired, and No. 7 Alabama spoiled the home finale of rival and No. 1 Auburn with a 93-91 overtime road win Saturday. The off-balance buzzer-beater from the free-throw line was only the third made basket of the game for Sears, who finished with nine points. Alabama (24-7, 13-5 Southeastern Conference) got 23 points from Grant Nelson and 15 points each from Labaron Philon and Clifford Omoruyi. The win ended a two-game losing skid for Alabama and handed a second straight loss for Auburn (27-4, 15-3). Johni Broome scored 34 points, including a game-tying layup in the final minute of regulation and a game-tying 3-pointer with 15 seconds left in overtime. Tahaad Pettiford added 19 points for Auburn, which was without second-leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara for the final 10:52 of regulation and overtime. Baker-Mazara was ejected for a Flagrant 2 foul on Alabama\u2019s Chris Youngblood. Takeaways Alabama: The Crimson Tide will enter the postseason with much-needed momentum, and they did it without having to overly rely on Sears offensively. That\u2019s a great sign for Nate Oats\u2019 team, which got 52 points in the paint Saturday. Auburn: The Tigers will look back at their miscues in this game, including allowing 10 Alabama offensive rebounds for 18 second-chance points. Defensive rebounding was an issue for Auburn earlier this week in a loss to Texas A&M. Key moment Sears\u2019 game-winning shot put an end to a back-and-forth final stretch between two of the best offenses in college basketball this season. Key stat Both teams\u2019 star players logged heavy minutes. Sears played 40 minutes for Alabama, while Broome played 43 for Auburn. Up next As top-four seeds in the SEC Tournament, Auburn and Alabama will both open the postseason on Friday in Nashville, Tenn. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-14 - Auburn: 62 vs Ole Miss: 57\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Johni Broome scored 23 points and grabbed 14 rebounds as regular-season champion Auburn opened its bid to repeat at the Southeastern Conference Tournament by holding off eighth-seeded Mississippi 62-57 Friday. The third-ranked Tigers (28-4) will play No. 8 Tennessee, an 83-72 winner over 13th-seeded Texas, in the semifinals Saturday. Denver Jones also had 13 points as Auburn snapped a two-game skid. Ole Miss (21-11) has lost two of its last three to top-five teams. Dre Davis and Sean Pedulla each had 12 points, and Malik Dia and Jaylen Murray 10 apiece. The Tigers showed some rust after being off since losing to Alabama in overtime last week. They led 29-22 at halftime but never were up more than 10. Takeaways Ole Miss: The Rebels now are 4-2 on a neutral site against Auburn and 2-2 at this tournament. They dropped to 1-4 in the quarterfinals and last reached the semifinals in 2013. Auburn: The Tigers have won this tournament three times, twice under coach Bruce Pearl. They also won this event in 2019 under Pearl and in 1985. They've won three league regular-season titles as well and their two tourney titles leads the SEC for most overall men's championships since 2018. Key moment Tied at 46 after a layup by Pedulla, Auburn went on an 11-1 run. Johnson's 3-pointer put the Tigers ahead to stay with 6:05 to go. Broome scored the next five, and Jones had a three-point play as Auburn went up 57-47. Key stat Up 60-57 with the clock ticking, Auburn went to Broome inside for a short jumper with 11.1 seconds left to seal the win as the Tigers hit six of their final eight shots. Up next Auburn won at Texas during the regular season and beat Tennessee by two on Jan. 25 on the Tigers' home court.

      "2025-03-15 - Auburn: 65 vs Tennessee: 70\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Zakai Zeigler scored 20 points as No. 8 Tennessee held off regular-season champion and third-ranked Auburn 70-65 on Saturday to reach the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship for the first time since 2022. The fourth-seeded Volunteers (27-6) got revenge both for their Jan. 25 loss at Auburn and their 2019 loss to the Tigers in this tournament's title game. Tennessee will play fourth-ranked Florida, a 104-82 winner over No. 5 Alabama, on Sunday for the tournament title. The Vols and the winner of that semifinal likely wind up with No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament \u2014 only fitting for the nation\u2019s best league. Jordan Gainey added 15 points for the Vols, and Chaz Lanier had 12. The Tigers (28-5) go home losers of three of their last four games. SEC player of the year Johni Broome led Auburn with 23 points, Miles Kelly added 13 and Denver Jones had 10. Auburn led 33-32 at halftime thanks to a late 10-0 spurt. The Tigers last led at 48-47. Takeaways Tennessee: The Vols are playing in their fourth final in the last seven tournaments. They won in Tampa in 2022 and lost the title game in both 2018 and 2019. They improved to 12-8 in this tournament under coach Rick Barnes, who got his 833rd career victory. Auburn: The Tigers came in looking for a fourth tournament title and third under coach Bruce Pearl. Not only did they win with Pearl last year and in 2019, they also won in 1985. Key moment Tennessee never trailed after a 13-1 run to go up 60-49 capped by Zeigler's 3 from the top of the circle with 7:17 left. Key stat The Vols had an edge at the free-throw line, making 25 of 27, including 18 of 20 in the second half. Auburn was 13 of 22. Jahmai Mashack sealed the win with 14 seconds left with the final pair. Up next Auburn will see where it lands in the NCAA Tournament Sunday.

    "profile_summary": "Auburn enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as the overall No. 1 seed with a 32-6 record and the SEC regular-season title outright \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that is undeniably elite, even accounting for a late-season stumble. The Tigers went an impressive 8-3 against ranked opponents in the regular season, with signature wins over then-No. 4 Houston (74-69), No. 5 Iowa State in Maui (83-81 in a comeback from 18 down), No. 12 North Carolina (85-72), No. 16 Purdue (87-69), No. 6 Tennessee (53-51), No. 2 Alabama (94-85 on the road), and No. 17 Kentucky (94-78), among others. Their only regular-season losses to ranked teams came at No. 9 Duke (78-84), at home to No. 6 Florida (81-90), at No. 22 Texas A&M (72-83), and in overtime at home to No. 7 Alabama (91-93) \u2014 none of which are embarrassing defeats given the competition. In the SEC Tournament, Auburn beat Ole Miss (62-57) before falling to Tennessee (65-70) in the semifinals, finishing the postseason portion of their schedule having lost three of their final four games overall. That late skid is the central concern entering March: the Tigers are not playing their best basketball right now, having dropped contests to Texas A&M, Alabama in OT, and Tennessee in Nashville, with the A&M loss particularly troubling as Broome managed only eight points on what appeared to be a nagging shoulder injury.\n\nAuburn's identity is built around the dominant two-way presence of Johni Broome \u2014 the SEC Player of the Year and a legitimate national player of the year candidate \u2014 who has delivered monster performances all season, including a 20-point, 20-rebound game against Ohio State, a 34-point effort in the overtime loss to Alabama, and consistent double-doubles throughout conference play. When Broome is healthy and assertive, Auburn is nearly unbeatable; when he is limited, as he was at Texas A&M (eight points) and during his ankle injury absence in January, the Tigers are still capable of winning \u2014 they went 2-0 without him in mid-January \u2014 but clearly more vulnerable. Surrounding Broome is a deep and versatile supporting cast: Miles Kelly provides explosive perimeter shooting (seven 3-pointers in the opener, a season-high 30 at Kentucky), Tahaad Pettiford is a dynamic bench scorer and clutch performer, Chad Baker-Mazara offers two-way wing play (though his Flagrant 2 ejection in the Alabama home finale raises a durability/discipline concern), and Denver Jones runs the offense with efficiency. Defensively, Auburn has been elite all season \u2014 forcing turnovers at a high rate, generating blocks in bunches (Dylan Cardwell had a career-high six against Oklahoma), and suffocating opponents with length \u2014 though they did allow 52 points in the paint to Alabama in their last home game and surrendered 24 offensive rebounds over their final two games, a troubling trend. Location-wise, Auburn was a fortress at home (60 consecutive non-conference home wins) and an extraordinary 10-0 in SEC road games before the Texas A&M loss, suggesting this group performs with rare confidence in hostile environments \u2014 a quality that translates well to neutral-site tournament play. The Tigers are a national title contender with a legitimate path to the Final Four and beyond, but the injury cloud over Broome, the three-of-four late-season losing skid, and demonstrated vulnerability to hot three-point shooting teams (Florida hit 13 threes to beat them at home) mean they are not a lock. Ceiling: **National Championship contender \u2014 if Broome is fully healthy, this is a Final Four team at minimum and one of the two or three most complete rosters in the country.**",

Hunter shot 7 of 11 from the floor for Clemson, which shot 29 of 61 (47.5%) from the floor. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers outclassed Florida State in every way, leading by as many as 27 points in the second half and shooting 5 of 11 from 3-point range after the break to cruise to a win. Florida State: The Seminoles lacked energy from the start, shot just 34 percent from the floor (18 of 53) and still have not defeated a top 25 team in 2024-25. Key moment Clemson used an early 10-0 run to separate, leading Florida State 22-7 with 10:30 to halftime and were never threatened. Key stat Clemson had 11 offensive rebounds, which led to 23 second-chance points. Up next Clemson has a bye and will play at SMU on Feb. 22; Florida State plays host to Miami on Wednesday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "2025-02-22 - SMU: 69 vs Clemson: 79\n\nDALLAS -- \u2014 Jaeden Zackery had 19 points, including a career-best five 3-pointers before halftime, plus six rebounds, seven assists and five steals to help No. 18 Clemson beat SMU 79-69 Saturday. Chase Hunter added 17 points and Viktor Lakhin had 16 for the Tigers (22-5, 14-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who are tied for second with Louisville and one-game behind Duke. Chuck Harris scored 16 points, and Matt Cross and B.J. Edwards had 12 each for the Mustangs (20-7, 11-5). Clemson ended the first half on a 7-2 run after SMU took its only lead of the game at 30-29, then scored the first nine points of the second half. The Tigers\u2019 largest lead was 18 points. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers tied a program record for conference wins set two years ago. They can match or surpass their highest poll position this season, which was No. 16 in mid-December. SMU: Boopie Miller, who leads the team averaging 13.4 points and 5.7 assists per game, missed his third consecutive game with a bruised left foot. A win could have vaulted the Mustangs into the Top 25 for the first time since the 2016-17 season. They\u2019re instead 0-3 against ranked teams, losing by an average of 17.3 points. Key moment Zackery\u2019s mid-range miss at the 24-second buzzer early in the second half was rebounded by Lakhin. That led to Hunter\u2019s 3-pointer amid the 9-0 run opening the second half. Key stat Clemson, 61st in Division I averaging nine 3-pointers per game, matched that total with 6:17 left in the half. The Tigers hit 14, matching their season high, on 29 shots.

Schieffelin, who also had nine rebounds, rescued the Tigers down the stretch of the first half with four straight baskets \u2014 his teammates has missed their previous 12 attempts \u2014 for a 41-31 halftime lead that Notre Dame (12-16, 6-11) could not overcome. Clemson (23-5, 15-2) surpassed its previous mark for conference victories of 14, set two seasons ago when the team missed out on the NCAAs. Schieffelin, a 6-foot-8 senior, topped his previous best of 23 points, set in a triple overtime loss to Georgia Tech here on Feb. 4. Viktor Lakhin added 18 points for Clemson. Markus Burton, the ACC's second-leading scorer coming in, had 30 points to lead the Irish. Takeaways Notre Dame: The Irish have had an awful February, losing six of the seven games played this month. Notre Dame's lack of presence down low cost it against Clemson as Schieffelin had his way in the first half with 16 points and six rebounds. Clemson: The Tigers overcame an awful shooting stretch in the opening half to take control. They'll need more consistency if want to make some noise during March as they did last year in reaching the Elite Eight. Key moment Clemson lost a nine-point lead and had missed 12 straight shots to trail the Irish. That's when Scheiffelin made the next four shots, including a 3-pointer and a three-point play to get the Tigers going again. Key stat Clemson had a season-low four turnovers.

      "2025-03-01 - Virginia: 58 vs Clemson: 71\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- \u2014 Ian Schieffelin scored 13 of his 21 points in the second half to help No. 13 Clemson come from behind to beat Virginia 71-58 on Saturday. Schieffelin, coming off a 24-point outing against Notre Dame, also grabbed 13 rebounds for his ninth double-double of the season, as the Tigers (24-5, 16-2 ACC) stayed a game behind first-place Duke in the conference standings. Isaac McKneely had 16 points for the Cavaliers (14-15, 7-11). Virginia had hit 10 or more 3-pointers in seven of its last 10 games before Saturday, but went 8 for 19 from beyond the arc. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers responded to a shaky start and strong Virginia effort with a dominant second half. Clemson outscored the Cavaliers 44-26 after the break to reach 24 victories for the second straight season. Virginia: Coming off a road win over Wake Forest on Wednesday, and seeking to snap an eight-game losing streak against ranked opponents, the Cavaliers played one of their better halves this season, taking a 32-27 lead to the locker room. But they could not sustain that level after the break, clinching their first losing season in ACC play since 2010-11. Key moment Clemson trailed by five at the half, but used a 20-2 surge early in the second half to take the lead. Schieffelin scored nine points during that run, as the Tigers went ahead 47-39 with 11:27 to go. Key stat Clemson scored 48 of its points in the paint, as Virginia had no answer to Schieffelin and Viktor Lakhin inside. It was the second straight game that Virginia\u2019s interior defense was badly exposed. The Cavaliers allowed a season-high 52 points in the paint in their win over Wake Forest.

      "2025-03-06 - Boston College: 69 vs Clemson: 78\n\nBOSTON -- \u2014 Jaeden Zackery returned to Chestnut Hill and scored 21 points against his former team, hitting a key 3-pointer after Boston College cut a 16-point deficit to two and leading No. 11 Clemson to a 78-69 victory Wednesday night. Chase Hunter added 18 points and Viktor Lakhin scored 11 with 13 rebounds to help the Tigers (25-5, 17-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) win their seventh straight game. Jayden Hastings scored 18 for Boston College (12-18, 4-15). Clemson led by 16 in the first half and still held a 62-53 edge midway through the second before BC scored seven straight points to make it a two-point game. But then Lakhin muscled one in underneath and Zackery hit a corner 3 to extend the lead to seven. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers have only lost twice in regulation all season. Their lone loss in the last two months was a triple-overtime defeat against Georgia Tech. Boston College: The Eagles have clinched one of the bottom three spots in the ACC and won\u2019t be going to the conference tournament. Key moment Zackery, who averaged just under 11 points per game in three seasons at BC before entering the transfer portal last offseason, gave former coach Earl Grant a big hug before the game. Key stat Clemson was 6 of 10 from 3-point range in the first half and 2 for 10 in the second. Up next Clemson hosts Virginia Tech on Saturday to finish the regular season, and BC wraps it up at Pittsburgh. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-08 - Clemson: 65 vs Virginia Tech: 47\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. -- \u2014 Viktor Lakhin scored 12 of his 16 points in the first half as No. 11 Clemson opened a double-digit lead and beat Virginia Tech 65-47 on Saturday for the program's record-tying 26th victory of the season. The Tigers (26-5, 18-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) matched a mark set by the 1990 team led by Dale Davis and Elden Campbell, who won Clemson's only ACC regular-season crown. These Tigers are playing every bit as good as that squad, winning their seventh straight game and heading into next week's ACC Tournament as a top-four seed. Lakhin, the 6-foot-11 transfer from Cincinnati, was dominant inside against the Hokies (13-18, 8-12), making six of his nine first-half shots as Clemson led 35-20 at the break. Brandon Rechsteiner led the Hokies with 11 points. Takeaways Virginia Tech: The Hokies have struggled down the stretch this season, losing nine of their final 13 games. They'll need to make a surprising run through the ACC Tournament \u2014 as they did in 2022 \u2014 to avoid missing the NCAAs for a third straight season. Clemson: The Tigers are rolling at the right time. They matched the program record for wins in a season and will have ample time for rest as one of the ACC's top four seeds for next week's postseason tournament. They hope to take an additional step or two this March after losing in the Elite Eight a year ago.

      "2025-03-14 - Clemson: 57 vs SMU: 54\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Chase Hunter scored 21 points, Jaeden Zackery added 11 points and No. 10 Clemson battled back to beat SMU 57-54 on Thursday night for its ninth straight win to reach the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals. Ian Schieffelin chipped in with nine points and 12 rebounds for the Tigers (27-5), who are seeking their first ACC Tournament title. Matt Cross led SMU (23-10) with 13 points, while Boopie Miller had 10. SMU led most of the second half, but Viktor Lakhin\u2019s lane jumper gave the Tigers a 52-51 lead with 4:50 left in the game. SMU had a chance to tie or take the lead after Hunter missed a 3 with 17 seconds left. The Mustangs called timeout with 12.5 seconds left, but Chuck Harris missed a corner 3. There was a battle for the rebound before the ball went out of bounds. It was initially ruled the ball went off a Clemson player, but after reviewing the play officials ruled SMU touched the ball last. Hunter was fouled on the inbounds play and made a free throw with 2.1 seconds. Cross' full-court heave at the buzzer fell short. Takeaways SMU: Cross picked up his fourth foul midway through the second half, but the Mustangs didn't waiver and stayed right with the Tigers until the end. Clemson: Starting guard Dillon Hunter appeared to jam a finger late in the first half and did not return. Coach Brad Brownell said after the game Hunter might have broken his hand. Hunter had an ice bag on his right hand in the locker room after the game. He will have X-rays on Friday. Key moment Hunter drove through the lane, stopped and then hit a turnaround jumper to put Clemson up by four with less than two minutes remaining. Key stat SMU finished 1 of 14 from 3-point range. Up next Clemson moves on to face No. 13 Louisville, a 75-73 winner over Stanford, in the semifinals. SMU looks to be headed to the NIT. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season.

Chucky Hepburn, the hero of Louisville\u2019s dramatic 75-73 quarterfinal win over Stanford, added 12 points for the Cardinals (27-6). Chase Hunter had 23 points for Clemson (27-6), while Ian Schieffelin had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Louisville is seeking its first ACC title on Saturday night, but No. 1 Duke, which held on to beat North Carolina 74-71 in the other semifinal, stands in its way. The Cardinals held Clemson without a field goal for more than six minutes in the second half to built a 67-52 lead with 3:50 left. But the Tigers cut their deficit to two with 54 seconds remaining on a layup from Hunter, who had 19 second-half points. After Louisville was called for a shot-clock violation, Clemson had the ball and chance to tie or take the lead. But James Scott blocked Hunter's drive after switching off his man. Hepburn made 1 of 2 free throws with 6 seconds left to make a three-point game and Hunter's leaning 3-point shot from 25 feet at the buzzer missed. Takeaways Clemson: The Tigers showed toughness battling back late in the fourth quarter and could prove to be a tough out in the NCAA Tournament. Louisville: The Cardinals may have shown a vulnerability as the Tigers were able to turn them over repeatedly with a full court press down the stretch. Key moment Scott's block on Hunter's layup was the game's biggest play, although Clemson was left screaming for a foul. Key stat There were 41 fouls called in the game.

    "profile_summary": "Clemson enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 5-seed with a 27-7 record, carrying one of the most impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the ACC and legitimate Elite Eight \u2014 or better \u2014 aspirations. The Tigers' quality wins are hard to ignore: they defeated then-No. 4 Kentucky 70-66 at home in December, knocked off No. 2 Duke 77-71 in February, and won the ACC regular-season title with a program-record 18 conference wins. Against ranked opponents, Clemson went approximately 3-4, with statement wins over Kentucky, Duke, and Penn State (neutral site), and losses to Memphis (OT), South Carolina (OT), Georgia Tech (triple OT), and Louisville (ACC Tournament semifinals) \u2014 every defeat either in overtime or in extremely close fashion, suggesting this team rarely gets blown out by quality competition. Their final five games read: a 78-69 win at Boston College, a 65-47 home throttling of Virginia Tech to tie the program wins record at 26, a gritty 57-54 ACC Tournament win over SMU, and then a 76-73 semifinal loss to Louisville after erasing a 15-point deficit \u2014 a sequence that shows both sustained excellence and the ability to compete until the final possession. Dillon Hunter suffered what may be a broken hand in the ACC Tournament, which is a notable concern heading into the bracket, as his perimeter shooting and defensive versatility provided meaningful depth off the bench.\n\nClemson is built around a genuinely elite frontcourt-backcourt combination: Chase Hunter, a sixth-year senior, is the engine of the offense, capable of erupting for 20-plus points on any given night and clutching up in late-game situations \u2014 he scored 23 points in the Louisville loss and consistently rises in big moments. Ian Schieffelin is a matchup nightmare at 6-foot-8, averaging a double-double and delivering a career-high 24 points against Notre Dame; his rebounding (a career-best 20 boards against Kentucky) and interior presence make Clemson nearly impossible to outwork on the glass. Viktor Lakhin provides a skilled, versatile complement at center \u2014 his 22-point performance against Duke and ability to step out and hit threes (four against North Carolina) gives the Tigers a legitimate third scoring option. Stylistically, Clemson wins through defensive discipline, paint dominance, and ball movement \u2014 they force turnovers in bunches (nine steals and 14 forced turnovers against Virginia Tech in the regular-season finale), convert second-chance points aggressively, and are capable of both wire-to-wire dominance and grinding out ugly late-game wins. They are slightly more vulnerable to high-scoring teams that hit from three at an elite rate, as Memphis (48% from three in an OT win) and Louisville exposed. On location, Clemson is clearly strongest at home (near-dominant), solid on the road (wins at Georgia Tech, Virginia, SMU, NC State, Miami), and has performed well on neutral sites (Sunshine Slam title, ACC Tournament run to the semis). This team carries itself with poise and resilience \u2014 they almost never collapse, they battle back from deficits, and their experienced core gives them a calm, veteran identity that travels. The verdict: Clemson is a legitimate Elite Eight contender and a credible Final Four threat if Chase Hunter stays hot and Schieffelin continues to dominate the interior \u2014 a team built for March that has already proven it can beat anyone in the country on the right night.",

    "profile_summary": "McNeese enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 12-seed with an impressive 28-7 record, built almost entirely on Southland Conference dominance \u2014 a 19-1 regular-season mark and an undefeated run through the conference tournament. Against genuinely elite competition, however, the Cowboys struggled: losses to South Dakota State, Alabama, Liberty, Santa Clara, and a ranked Mississippi State squad (who were No. 25 at the time) reveal a team that has been tested outside its conference and often come up short. That Mississippi State loss is the most instructive \u2014 McNeese led 58-55 with five minutes left before being outscored 11-5 down the stretch, a troubling pattern of late-game vulnerability against high-major opponents. Their only neutral-site r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is mixed: 2-2 at the Paradise Jam, beating Illinois State and Longwood but losing to Liberty. Ranked game record: 0-1 against ranked opponents (0-1 vs. Mississippi State), with additional losses to quality mid-major programs. The Cowboys' style is built around offensive versatility \u2014 they can beat you with Javohn Garcia attacking the rim, DJ Richards bombing threes (6-for-7 in one game against Northwestern State), Christian Shumate as a physical interior presence, or Sincere Parker erupting off the bench for 31 points as he did against Longwood. Quadir Copeland adds elite playmaking, posting 11 assists and 5 steals in a single game against LeTourneau. The five-game closing stretch tells a compelling story: wins over UT Rio Grande Valley (100-65), Lamar (68-66 in a nail-biter), Stephen F. Austin (95-64), Northwestern State (83-64 in the conference semis), and Lamar again (63-54 in the conference title game) \u2014 a 9-game win streak entering the tournament, with margins ranging from dominant blowouts to one very close escape in Beaumont. The Cowboys play with genuine confidence and energy, rarely appearing flat, but that Lamar regular-season win \u2014 where Sincere Parker needed 25 points and 10-of-12 free throw shooting to escape by two on the road \u2014 hints at a team that can be pushed to the edge by motivated opponents. McNeese is clearly a home-court powerhouse (dominant wire-to-wire wins at Legacy Center all conference season) but less reliable on the road and neutral sites, going just 2-2 at the Paradise Jam and losing at Mississippi State in a game they had well in hand. Their tournament ceiling is a dangerous second-round run at best: McNeese is exactly the kind of hot, multi-threat 12-seed capable of stunning a 5-seed that underestimates them, but their inability to close out elite opponents under pressure and their untested r\u00e9sum\u00e9 beyond the Southland make a Sweet 16 appearance an unlikely outcome.",

Fousseyni Traore added 15 points and Trevin Knell had 14 for the fourth-seeded Cougars (24-8), who went 18 of 36 from beyond the arc to set a tournament record for made 3-pointers, and advanced to play No. 2 Houston or Colorado in the semifinals. Jones hit seven 3s of his own and scored 31 points, and Milan Momcilovic had 18 for the short-handed Cyclones (24-9), who had won their last four games at the Big 12 tourney, including their run to the championship a year ago. No. 5 seed Iowa State played without Keshon Gilbert, their second-leading scorer and top distributor, and point guard Tamin Lipsey, who had started all 101 games he had played in his career. Gilbert tried to play through a muscle strain against Cincinnati but went only 11 minutes, while Lipsey strained his groin in the closing minutes of the second-round win. BYU was without Kanon Catchings, who missed his third consecutive game after hurting his knee against West Virginia. The Cougars and Cyclones nevertheless picked up where they left off last week, when BYU ruined senior day at Iowa State in a double-overtime thriller. They raced up and down the floor, combined to hit 20 first-half 3-pointers, and Jones poured in 22 points \u2014 and hit eight straight shots at one point \u2014 to help the Cyclones to a 53-49 lead at the break. The Cougars still trailed 72-64 with 12 1/2 minutes to go when they went on an 11-0 run, and Mihailo Boskovic's 3-pointer gave them a 75-72 lead. Iowa State tied the game again moments later but was never able to regain the lead. BYU finished it off in the final minute from the foul line, where it was 18 of 21 for the game. Takeaways Iowa State was cautious with its two star guards in the hopes that they can be healthy for the NCAA Tournament. Gilbert was ruled out early and watched in street clothes while Lipsey tried to warm up but never entered the game. BYU committed 29 turnovers when it beat Iowa State last week. It had only 10 in the quarterfinal rematch. Key moment Saunders hit his third 3-pointer with 49.1 seconds left to give BYU a 92-88 lead.

Milos Uzan added 14 points and Mylik Wilson pulled down 13 rebounds, helping the tournament's top seed jump to a big early lead and roll into Saturday night's matchup with Arizona on a 12-game win streak. Houston (29-4) played without J'Wan Roberts, its leading rebounder, after he sprained his ankle early in the second half of the Cougars' quarterfinal win over Colorado. Roberts watched from the bench with his right foot in a walking boot. He got to watch quite a defensive show by one of the nation's best. Houston forced BYU to miss its first nine shots, including seven from beyond the arc, where coach Kevin Young's team had set a Big 12 Tournament record with 18 made 3s on its way to 96 points in a quarterfinal win over Iowa State. That nearly seven-minute lull allowed Houston to roar to a 15-0 lead that it spent the rest of the game protecting. BYU trimmed its 40-21 halftime deficit to 13 midway through the second half but never threatened to come all the way back. Keba Keita had 14 points and 12 rebounds for BYU. Dawson Baker scored 11 points and Richie Saunders had 10. Takeaways BYU still has not won a conference tournament title since 2001 in the Mountain West. Houston lived up to its billing as the nation's No. 1 team in defensive efficiency. Key moment Sharpe converted a four-point play with 13:40 left in the first half to give Houston its 15-0 lead.

    "profile_summary": "BYU enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed with a 26-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that tells the story of a team that found itself late and is peaking at exactly the right moment. Against ranked opponents, the Cougars went an impressive 5-6, with signature wins over No. 23 Kansas (91-57 at home), No. 19 Arizona (96-95 on the road on a Richie Saunders game-winning free throw), No. 10 Iowa State (88-85 in double overtime on the road), and No. 12 Iowa State again in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals (96-92). Their losses to ranked teams include a pair of blowouts at the hands of No. 2 Houston \u2014 by 31 points in January and by 20 in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals \u2014 which represents the clearest ceiling concern on this r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Cougars stumbled badly in mid-January through early February, dropping five of seven games including road losses to TCU, Utah, and Cincinnati, but they responded by reeling off eight straight wins to close the regular season before advancing to the Big 12 semifinal. Their final five games (wins over West Virginia, Iowa State in double OT, Utah, a Big 12 quarterfinal win over Iowa State, and a semifinal loss to Houston) produced a 4-1 record against formidable competition, with margins of +21, +3 (2OT), +11, +4, and -20 \u2014 a hot streak with one sobering reminder of their ceiling.\n\nBYU is a three-point shooting team that lives and dies by the arc \u2014 they went 18-of-36 from deep in the Big 12 quarterfinal win over Iowa State and set a tournament record for made threes, but were held to 0-of-7 from three in the opening minutes against Houston before the game was effectively over. Richie Saunders is their engine, averaging north of 20 points in the final stretch with clutch performances (23 points, 13-of-13 from the free throw line at Iowa State; a go-ahead reverse layup at Arizona; game-winning free throws against the Wildcats) that mark him as a genuine tournament-caliber scorer. Freshman Egor Demin brings elite playmaking at 15-plus points and 7-plus assists in key games, while Fousseyni Traore provides a reliable interior presence off the bench \u2014 his 20-point, 10-rebound effort against West Virginia and 15 points in the Big 12 quarterfinal show he can elevate when needed. Notably, Kanon Catchings missed the final three regular season games and the Big 12 quarterfinal with a knee injury and his availability is a genuine concern entering the tournament. BYU is demonstrably stronger at home (8-0 to start the season; dominant wins over Kansas and Baylor in Provo) and has historically struggled on the road, though their road wins at Colorado, West Virginia, Iowa State, and Arizona in the back half of the season show real growth. This is a team that is confident, streaky, and capable of erupting offensively when the three-ball is falling, but is also prone to collapses \u2014 they blew a 21-point lead at Iowa State before winning in double overtime, and they committed 29 turnovers in that same game. The Houston blueprint is clear: swarming defense, force turnovers, and take away the three-point line, and BYU goes flat. **Realistic tournament ceiling: Sweet 16.** The Cougars have more than enough firepower and recent momentum to knock off an 11-seed and push through to the second weekend, but their dependence on three-point shooting, road fragility on neutral sites against elite defenses, and the Houston blowouts suggest a team that is a dangerous upset pick rather than a legitimate Final Four contender.",

    "profile_summary": "VCU enters the 2025 NCAA tournament as an 11-seed with a 28-7 record and the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament championship in hand \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a genuinely good mid-major program that has earned its tournament spot through consistent excellence in conference play rather than a marquee non-conference schedule. The Rams went 15-3 in A-10 play, sharing the regular-season title with George Mason before beating the Patriots in the conference championship game, and their non-conference ledger shows some real limitations: losses to Seton Hall (in overtime), Nevada (on a buzzer-beater 3), and New Mexico (where Donovan Dent dropped 40 points and VCU had no answer) suggest the Rams can be exposed when facing high-caliber individual talent or elite offensive efficiency. Their wins over Colorado State and Boston College show some credibility outside the A-10, but there are no true marquee r\u00e9sum\u00e9-builders, and the 11-seed reflects that reality. Heading into the tournament, VCU is playing its best basketball of the season: over their final five summarized games \u2014 wins over George Mason (70-54), Richmond (78-60), Davidson (80-56), Duquesne (71-62), and the A-10 Tournament run capped by a 68-63 championship win over George Mason \u2014 the Rams have won ten straight, with each victory coming by double digits except the championship game, where they survived a late Patriots surge with clutch execution from Max Shulga and Joe Bamisile down the stretch.\n\nVCU's identity is built around a balanced, multi-threat offensive attack anchored by Shulga and Bamisile, with Phillip Russell, Zeb Jackson, and Jack Clark providing meaningful secondary scoring \u2014 there is no clear single-stop solution for opposing defenses. Shulga, the Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, has been exceptional late in the season: he delivered 22 points against George Mason, 22 against Duquesne, and hit the step-back 3-pointer late in the conference championship that all but sealed the title, going 8-of-9 from the free-throw line in a pressure moment. Bamisile complements him as a high-volume, versatile scorer capable of 20-plus-point outbursts, while Clark provides inside-out toughness and Jackson gives the Rams a dangerous bench weapon. The team shows genuine composure in close games \u2014 they engineered a 12-0 second-half run at Dayton to win, and rallied past Loyola Chicago in the A-10 semis after trailing in the second half \u2014 but they can also be rattled when opponents make big runs, as George Mason's back-to-back threes in the championship nearly erased an eight-point halftime lead. At home, VCU has been dominant, rarely allowing opponents to stay competitive for a full game, but on the road they have shown vulnerability: losses to Saint Louis, New Mexico, and Nevada all came away from Richmond, and their 4-3 record in true road and neutral-site games against quality opponents raises legitimate questions about their ability to handle elite environments. The 11-seed Rams are a genuinely dangerous first-round opponent and a realistic Sweet 16 threat if the bracket sets up favorably, but their non-conference losses to superior offensive talent and their tendency to allow runs against quality opponents puts a Elite Eight or deeper run firmly out of reach \u2014 **this team's realistic ceiling is the Sweet 16, with a second-round upset very much in play**.",

      "2025-03-12 - Saint Mary's: 51 vs Gonzaga: 58\n\nLAS VEGAS -- \u2014 The metrics \u2014 and oddsmakers \u2014 indicated Gonzaga was far better than its record, and there was little doubt the Bulldogs had the ability to once again compete at a high level. Maybe it was simply a matter of timing. Braden Huff scored 18 points in just his second start of the season as Gonzaga avenged two regular-season losses to Saint Mary's, beating the 19th-ranked Gaels 58-51 in the West Coast Conference Tournament championship on Tuesday night. The Bulldogs (25-8) secured the WCC's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, though both teams were safely in the field regardless of the outcome. \u201cWe've had an inordinate amount of one-possession games,\u201d Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \u201cI think that's why we're such an interesting seed going into this NCAA Tournament. I think we were 350th in luck in Kenpom. We've had more banked 3s on us than I could ever, ever remember in my entire career. \"Whether it's law of averages coming through or just a little resiliency ... or maybe it's just desperation by some seniors who don't want this thing to end.\u201d The Bulldogs also got some measure of revenge for losing to the Gaels in last year's title game, which ended Gonzaga's run of four conference championships and 10 of 11. Gonzaga also extended its national record to 18 consecutive 25-win seasons. Saint Mary's (28-5) had its seven-game winning streak stopped. The Gaels also had won 17 of 18 games. \u201cWe've had a great year,\u201d Saint Mary's coach Randy Bennett said. \u201cWe did not play well tonight.\u201d Khalif Battle scored 14 points for the Zags, Graham Ike added 11 and Ryan Nembhard had 10. Mitchell Saxen led Saint Mary's with 20 points but scored only six after halftime. Two-time WCC Player of the Year Augustas Marciulionis finished with 12 points. Saint Mary\u2019s was attempting to become the first team since San Diego in 1996-97 to beat Gonzaga three times in a season. But Gonzaga entered the game with the higher Kenpom rating, ninth to 22nd for the Gaels, and was a 3 1/2-point favorite at Sportsbook. \u201cYou've got to go through some hardships in order to win,\u201d Battle said. \u201cWe've been practicing for this moment. I think we were prepared more than ever going into this tournament, so I'm happy we were able to hoist the trophy.\u201d Takeaways Gonzaga: The Bulldogs committed just four turnovers while forcing 18 that included two shot-clock violations in the closing minutes. Saint Mary's: The Gaels are the first ranked team since No. 25 Texas A&M in 2011 to go at least 0 for 16 from 3-point range and commit 18 or more turnovers. Key moment Marciulionis' layup with 15:09 left brought Saint Mary's within a point, but the Gaels went the next 7:36 without a field goal as Gonzaga built a 48-42 lead. Key stats The teams combined to shoot 1 of 31 on 3-pointers, the third-worst combined percentage in any game over the past 20 years. Saint Mary's went 0 for 16.

    "profile_summary": "Gonzaga enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 8-seed with a 26-9 record that dramatically undersells their actual quality \u2014 coach Mark Few himself noted the Bulldogs ranked 350th in KenPom luck, citing an \"inordinate amount of one-possession games\" and more banked threes against them than he could ever remember. Against ranked opponents, the Zags went an impressive 5-7, with signature wins over then-No. 8 Baylor (101-63, their largest margin over a top-10 opponent in school history), No. 14 Indiana (89-73), and No. 19 Saint Mary's in the WCC Tournament championship (58-51), while suffering narrow losses to No. 4 Kentucky (89-90 OT), No. 18 UConn (71-77), No. 22 UCLA (62-65), and Saint Mary's twice in the regular season. Their final five games tell a compelling story of a team catching fire at the right time: a 95-76 win at Santa Clara, a 95-75 regular-season finale win at San Francisco, a WCC quarterfinal win over San Francisco (85-76), and then the WCC championship upset of Saint Mary's \u2014 four straight wins capped by a gritty, turnover-forcing performance in which Gonzaga committed just four turnovers while forcing 18. The Bulldogs extended their national record to 18 consecutive 25-win seasons and avenged both regular-season losses to the Gaels to close the year on a high note.\n\nStylistically, Gonzaga is a multi-dimensional, offense-first team capable of going wire-to-wire in blowouts \u2014 they routed Baylor by 38, Portland twice (105-62, 81-50), and Pepperdine by 52 \u2014 but they are equally capable of tight-game vulnerability, as their losses to Oregon State (89-97 OT), Santa Clara (99-103), and UCLA (62-65) demonstrated during a mid-season rough patch. The engine of this team is senior point guard Ryan Nembhard, the nation's assists leader (295 assists, 9.8 per game) who recorded back-to-back 15-assist games to close the regular season; his playmaking and ball security (4.15 assist-to-turnover ratio) give Gonzaga an elite offensive architecture. Graham Ike is the team's premier scorer and rebounder \u2014 posting 26 points and nine rebounds against Oregon State and 28 and 11 against Kentucky \u2014 while Khalif Battle provides explosive scoring off the bench and Braden Huff (9-of-10 shooting against Pepperdine) offers efficient frontcourt depth. Nolan Hickman's three-point shooting (five threes against Washington State) adds another perimeter weapon. Location-wise, the Zags are dominant at home (losing only once, to Santa Clara) but have been inconsistent on neutral courts (3-4), with close neutral-site losses to Kentucky and UCLA tempered by the WCC Tournament run. As an 8-seed, Gonzaga is one of the most dangerous teams in the bracket \u2014 a program with Final Four pedigree, elite playmaking, and genuine star power arriving at peak form. Their realistic ceiling is the Elite Eight: experienced and talented enough to knock off a 1-seed in an upset, but their neutral-site inconsistency and vulnerability to elite perimeter shooting (Santa Clara's 18 threes exposed them) make a Final Four run a stretch rather than an expectation.",

Tre Johnson's three-point play got Texas within a point, 9-8, but Georgia sandwiched two Asa Newell field goals around Dakota Leffew's three-pointer to take a 16-8 lead, and after Demary scored on a tip-in and a layup, the Bulldogs had a double-digit lead. Blue Cain hit from deep with :12 left in the half to make it 46-29 at the break. Georgia was 17 of 30 from the field (56.7%) in the first half, including 5 of 10 from long range.

Georgia scored the opening six points of the game and led throughout. South Carolina got within 49-47 with 9:24 left in the second half after Nick Pringle completed a three-point play, but the Gamecocks did not make another field goal until the 2:50 mark. After South Carolina forward Collin Murray-Boyles missed two free throws with 52.3 seconds left that could have cut the deficit to four points, Dylan James completed a three-point play at the other end to make it 69-60. Freshman Asa Newell scored 11 points on 3-of-10 shooting for Georgia (19-11, 7-10 SEC), which also bested the Gamecocks 71-60 on Jan. 28.

      "2025-03-13 - Georgia: 75 vs Oklahoma: 81\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Jeremiah Fears scored 29 points to lead No. 14 seed Oklahoma to an 81-75 victory over 11th-seeded Georgia on Wednesday night in a first-round game of the SEC Tournament.

    "profile_summary": "Georgia enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 9-seed with a 20-13 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine moments of brilliance undermined by persistent inconsistency, particularly against elite competition. The Bulldogs' season narrative is defined by an extraordinary gauntlet: they faced a school-record 12 Top-25 opponents during SEC play, going 3-9 against ranked teams in conference, with quality wins over No. 6 Kentucky (82-69), No. 17 Oklahoma (72-62), No. 3 Florida (88-83), and a narrow 70-68 home loss to No. 1 Auburn that came down to a final possession. Their ranked record overall sits roughly 4-11, meaning they've been beaten far more often than not against elite competition, but those four wins carry real weight \u2014 the Florida victory in particular, snapping a 12-game series losing streak and sending fans storming the court, stands as the signature moment of their season. Georgia's recent form is a mixed picture: they won four straight to close the regular season \u2014 beating Florida, Texas (83-67 wire-to-wire), South Carolina, and Vanderbilt \u2014 before losing 81-75 to 14-seed Oklahoma in the first round of the SEC Tournament, a genuinely alarming exit that snapped their momentum just days before Selection Sunday. In that tournament loss, Jeremiah Fears torched them for 29 points and Oklahoma shot 52% in the first half, with Georgia never fully recovering from a 10-0 run that put the game out of reach late \u2014 a collapse pattern that has recurred all season, most notably in a 26-4 second-half run surrendered to Tennessee and a 22-0 run absorbed at Texas A&M.\n\nStylistically, Georgia is a multi-faceted but volatile team: they are capable of dominant first halves and wire-to-wire wins, as demonstrated against Texas and in their home blowouts of Kentucky and Oklahoma, but they are dangerously prone to second-half collapses and extended scoring droughts, shooting 17-of-58 in the Ole Miss opener and going scoreless for stretches in multiple road losses. The engine of this team is freshman Asa Newell, a 6-foot-11 consensus five-star recruit who has delivered double-digit scoring in nearly every game and is coming off 21 points and 17 rebounds in the SEC Tournament loss \u2014 he is a legitimate pro prospect and a matchup nightmare at the college level. Sophomore guard Silas Demary Jr. has emerged as the team's other alpha, earning SEC Player of the Week honors after averaging 23.5 points in wins over Florida and Texas, and he scored 24 in the tournament loss. The supporting cast \u2014 Dakota Leffew off the bench, Blue Cain, and transfers RJ Godfrey and De'Shayne Montgomery \u2014 provides enough depth to be dangerous, though Tyrin Lawrence's hamstring injury is a concern worth monitoring. Geographically, Georgia is dramatically better at home (13-2 at Stegeman Coliseum) than on the road, where they've absorbed blowout losses at Florida (89-59), Alabama (90-69), and Texas A&M (69-53) \u2014 neutral-site results are a smaller sample but include a win over St. John's and the loss to Marquette in the Bahamas, suggesting middling performance away from Athens. The Bulldogs play with genuine resilience and competitive spirit \u2014 they rallied from 17 down to beat South Carolina State and came back from a 78-67 deficit to beat Florida \u2014 but they lack the defensive consistency and offensive composure to sustain pressure against elite opponents for 40 minutes. **Realistic ceiling: Round of 32.** Newell and Demary give Georgia enough firepower to knock off their 8-seed opponent in a first-round upset scenario, but the recurring second-half collapses, road/neutral-site struggles, and the fresh wound of losing to a 14-seed Oklahoma team in the SEC Tournament make a run to the Sweet 16 unlikely without a dramatic reversal of their most persistent flaws.",

      "2024-11-05 - Tennessee: 80 vs Gardner-Webb: 64\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier scored 18 points and Jordan Gainey had 16 as No. 12 Tennessee beat Gardner-Webb 80-64 on Monday night in the season opener for both teams. Zakai Zeigler added 13 points and nine assists for the Volunteers, while Jahmai Mashack scored 10. Felix Okpara led the Vols' rebounding with nine. Darryl Simmons scored 22 points to lead the Bulldogs, and Anthony Selden and Jamaine Mann each had 13. Gardner-Webb outrebounded Tennessee 32-29, with Isaiah Richards leading the way with eight. Takeaways Gardner-Webb: Coach Jeremy Luther\u2019s first game at Gardner-Webb was a whopper. The Bulldogs will be spending the early part of the season trying to fit five new faces into the rotation. Tennessee: After a four-point exhibition loss to Indiana, the Vols cleaned up their shooting woes (they shot 24% in the first half of the exhibition and 31% for the game). The improvement will need to show as the season goes on. They still need to find the \u201chair on fire\u201d defense that made them special last season. Key moment Midway through the first half, Tennessee led by three. The Vols went on a 12-3 run that gave them a double-digit lead. Lanier, a transfer from North Florida, scored eight in a row. That gave Tennessee its breathing room. Key stat Gardner-Webb scored 34 points in the paint against a Tennessee front line that's supposed to be much more physical than the Bulldogs. The Vols got caught a step slow on several exchanges.

      "2024-11-09 - Louisville: 55 vs Tennessee: 77\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier and Zakai Zeigler each scored 19 points and No. 12 Tennessee held Louisville to 27% shooting in a 77-55 rout on Saturday. The Volunteers (2-0), who shot 57%, outrebounded the Cardinals 40-26 (28 defensively) and outscored them 40-10 in the paint in the first meeting between the schools since 2018. Tennessee led 10-0 after five minutes and several times by at least 20 points, pulling away for the last time after Louisville (1-1) closed within 47-38 early in the second half. Zeigler made 7 of 13 from the field, including 4 of 7 from beyond the arc. Lanier went 7-of-15 shooting and 3 of 6 from long range as Tennessee made 10 of 19 (53%) on 3s. Reyne Smith came off the bench to score 18 points for the Cardinals, who shot 16 of 60 for the game. That included just 10 of 39 from beyond the arc (26%). Takeaways Tennessee: The Volunteers showed their quickness and athleticism throughout on both ends, going hard to the rim on offense and sealing off the lane defensively. They were sometimes ragged in committing 20 turnovers, but that led to just 12 points thanks to the Cardinals' errors. Louisville: The Cardinals initially struggled controlling the ball, and then it was getting off a shot against the Vols' defense. That left them firing from long range, which often resulted in misses other than the one second-half stretch in which they closed within single digits. Key moment After Louisville got within nine with 13:17 remaining, Tennessee went on a 12-2 run over the next 4:12 to slam the door. Key stat Tennessee scored 20 points off 15 Louisville turnovers. Up next Tennessee hosts Montana on Wednesday night, while Louisville has a break before hosting crosstown Bellarmine on Nov. 19. ------ AP college basketball: and",
      "2024-11-14 - Tennessee: 92 vs Montana: 57\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Igor Milicic Jr. had 18 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, and No. 11 Tennessee beat Montana 92-57 on Wednesday night. Chaz Lanier, Felix Okpara and Cameron Carr each scored 13 points for the Volunteers (3-0). Zakai Zeigler had 11 points, seven assists and six rebounds. The 6-foot-10 Milicic also had two steals and made two 3-pointers. Money Williams led Montana (2-2) with 30 points. Takeaways Montana: Six of the Grizzlies\u2019 nine-man rotation are playing at Montana for the first time. That leaves for a pretty steep learning curve so early in the season, especially against the No. 11 team in the country. Tennessee: A week ago, Gardner-Webb scored 64 points in a loss to Tennessee. More than half (34) of those points came in the paint. That was a concern for Vols coach Rick Barnes. With an emphasis on defense down low, Tennessee allowed just 10 against Louisville but had a bit of a regression against Montana (22). Key moment A 13-2 run to start the second half allowed Tennessee to turn a nine-point halftime lead into an 18-point advantage that gave the Vols some breathing room. Chaz Lanier had eight of those points. Key stat Tennessee committed nine turnovers in the first half. The Vols had just one in the first 14 minutes of the second half and stretched the lead to 23.

      "2024-11-17 - Tennessee: 103 vs Austin Peay: 68\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Igor Milicic scored 23 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and Zakai Zeigler had 19 points and eight assists to lead No. 11 Tennessee to a 103-68 victory over Austin Peay on Sunday afternoon. Jordan Gainey scored 15, Cade Phillips added 13 and Felix Okpara had 12 points to help the Volunteers (4-0). Jahmai Mashack also scored 10 for Tennessee. Isaac Haney had 22 points, and LJ Thomas scored 20 to lead the way for the Governors (3-1). Takeaways Austin Peay: Picked to finish second in the Atlantic Sun Conference, the Governors played well against Tennessee. Thomas, an NC State transfer, adds credibility to the lineup, and one-armed player Hansel Enmanuel is a motivating factor for the team. Tennessee: Tennessee utilized a trapping defense that caused Montana problems in the second half last week. After having success with it against the Governors, that could be something the Vols can count on. Key moment Tennessee's 21-2 early in the first half set the tone for the rest of the game, and Milicic, Phillips and Okpara combined for 12 of those points. Key stats The Vols held a 64-22 advantage for points in the paint and outrebounded the Governors 43-25. Up next Austin Peay plays at Morehead State Wednesday, and Tennessee plays Virginia on Thursday in the semifinals of the Continental Tire Baha Mar Championship in Nassau, Bahamas. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-22 - Tennessee: 64 vs Virginia: 42\n\nNASSAU, Bahamas -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier scored 26 points and Igor Milicic Jr. had 14 points and eight rebounds against his former team as No. 11 Tennessee pulled away from Virginia in the second half for a 64-42 win at the Baha Mar Championship on Thursday night. The Volunteers found themselves locked in a tight contest going to the locker room, their lead trimmed to 22-21 when Virginia\u2019s Andrew Rohde hit a long, straightaway three in the final seconds of the half. After the break, the Volunteers grabbed control of the game, taking advantage of misses and turnovers to turn the contest into a rout. Dai Dai Ames led the Cavaliers with 12 points and Rohde added eight, but UVA shot just 28.6% from the floor. Tennessee held leading scorer Isaac McKneely to four points on 1-for-6 shooting. Takeaways Virginia: In its first major test of the Ron Sanchez interim era, UVA\u2019s deliberate style and defensive intensity kept things interesting before getting overwhelmed by a superior opponent in the second half. Tennessee: The Volunteers shook off a shaky first half and took control physically in the second. Tennessee outscored UVA 19-5 in second-chance points and had eight steals, using its size and athleticism to dominate. Key moment Tennessee asserted itself with a 9-0 run early in the second half, aided by three Virginia turnovers. That surge swelled the margin to 37-24 with 13:06 left and, though the Cavaliers tried to hang around, the outcome was decided. Key stat Virginia\u2019s poor shooting was a problem, but maybe not as much as its 18 turnovers that led to 30 Tennessee points.

      "2024-11-23 - Baylor: 62 vs Tennessee: 77\n\nNASSAU, Bahamas -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier made seven 3-pointers and scored 25 points \u2014 all in the first half \u2014 as No. 11 Tennessee cruised past No. 13 Baylor 77-62 on Friday night to win the Baha Mar Championship title. Lanier took the drama out of the game early, making five 3-pointers in the first four minutes to carry the Volunteers (6-0) to a 16-2 lead. His final 3 just before the halftime buzzer gave Tennessee a 47-20 advantage. Lanier finished 9 of 16 from the field and 7 of 10 from 3-point range and was named the tournament's MVP. Jordan Gainey added 16 points to Tennessee. Coming off a double-overtime victory over No. 22 St. John's on Jeremy Roach's buzzer-beater a night earlier, Baylor (4-2) outscored Tennessee 42-30 in the second half to make it respectable. Norchad Omier finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds and VJ Edgecombe scored 20 points for the Bears. Roach was held to eight points. Takeaways Tennessee: A night after a ragged first half had the Vols clinging to a one-point intermission advantage against Virginia, Tennessee came out firing and Baylor had no answer. Baylor: The Bears showed the effect of playing two overtimes Thursday night. This time, they couldn't mount an improbable comeback from a big first-half deficit. Key moment Lanier\u2019s 15-point onslaught in the opening four minutes set the tone. Tennessee led 23-4 with 11:40 left in the half. Key stat Baylor went 6 of 22 (27.3%) from 3-point range. Tennessee went 12 of 27 (44.4%). Up next Tennessee hosts UT Martin on Wednesday. Baylor hosts New Orleans on Wednesday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-27 - Tennessee: 78 vs UT Martin: 35\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier scored 18 and No. 7 Tennessee extended its season-opening winning streak to seven games with a 78-35 victory over UT Martin on Wednesday. Felix Okpara had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Volunteers (7-0). Zakai Zeigler added 11 points and nine assists, and Igor Milicic had 13 rebounds and nine points. The Skyhawks (2-5) were led by Josu Grullon's 15 points. Lanier scored 11 points in the first half as Tennessee built a 35-20 lead at the half. Grullon had 10 for UT Martin. Takeaways UT Martin: Dropped its fifth straight after two opening wins under first-year coach Jeremy Shulman. After 21 wins last year, the Skyhawks brought in 16 newcomers this season. They are picked to finish 10th in the Ohio Valley Conference. Tennessee: After receiving the news that 6-foot-9 sophomore J.P. Estrella will miss the entire season with a foot injury, the Vols have had to go back to the drawing board to determine their rotation on the front court. Estrella had been coming off the bench with Cade Phillips to spell Igor Milicic and Felix Okpara. What that big man rotation looks like will be interesting. Key moment From late in the first half to early in the second half, Tennessee scored 14 straight points and turned a 10-point lead into a 44-20 advantage. Zakai Zeigler had five of those points. Key stat UT Martin committed 18 turnovers. Five of those were shot-clock violations. Tennessee scored 24 points off the turnovers. Up next UT Martin will be at Charleston Southern next Tuesday.

      "2024-12-04 - Tennessee: 96 vs Syracuse: 70\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier scored 26 points to lead No. 3 Tennessee to a 96-70 victory over Syracuse in the SEC/ACC Challenge on Tuesday night. The Volunteers (8-0) got a double-double from Igor Milicic with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Zakai Zeigler had 14 points and eight assists. Jordan Gainey scored all 12 of his points in the second half, and Cade Phillips also had 12. Tennessee finished with a 39-26 rebounding advantage. Elijah Moore paced the Orange (4-3) with 24 points off the bench. Chris Bell added 12 and Donnie Freeman had 10. Tennessee ran off 10 straight points midway through the first half and rode that to a 45-35 halftime lead. Lanier had 11 points at the break. Takeaways Syracuse: Freeman, a touted freshman, is making an early impact. His double-double (23 points, 12 rebounds) in a win over Colgate helped him earn co-ACC Freshman of the Week honors. The five-star recruit could be a key component as the season heats up. Tennessee: After missing the first four games due to a personal issue, Darlinstone Dubar is beginning to find a place in the big-man rotation. With the season-long absence of J.P. Estrella because of foot surgery, the 6-foot-6 Dubar can fill a role off the bench. He was at Iowa State for a year and Hofstra for three before landing at Tennessee. Key moment Midway through the first half, Zeigler connected on a 3-pointer \u2014 one of two in the entire half. He was fouled in the process and hit the free throw for a four-point play and 10-point advantage. Key stat Tennessee's frontline of Phillips, Milicic and Felix Okpara was dominant. The trio combined for 31 points and 23 rebounds. Up next Syracuse opens ACC play Saturday at Notre Dame.

Igor Milicic Jr. added 16 and nine rebounds for the Volunteers, who took the top spot in the AP Top 25 this week for the first time since February 2019. Zakai Zeigler added 13 points and nine assists for Tennessee, which pulled away late in the first half and withstood a Miami comeback attempt for its first 9-0 start since 2000-01. Lynn Kidd scored 14 as the Hurricanes (3-8) dropped their seventh straight game. Nyjel Pack added 12 and AJ Station-McCray added 11 for Miami, which shot 39.3%. The Hurricanes held a two-point lead on a hook shot by Kidd with 7:52 remaining in the first half. The Volunteers never trailed after Ziegler hit three free throws 30 seconds later to start a 14-0 run. Takeaways Tennessee: The Volunteers won their ninth straight by double digits and looked the part of a top-ranked team. Miami: The Hurricanes started decently by making four of their first seven 3s but finished 8 of 33.

After Illinois tied the game at 64 on the second of two free throws by Kasparas Jakucionis with 5.7 seconds left, Gainey took control. The Vols' senior guard inbounded the ball to Igor Milicic, got it back and raced three-quarters the length of the court and scored over Jakucionis as time ran out. Chaz Lanier scored 17 points for Tennessee before fouling out with 3:42 left. Milicic had 14 rebounds and a key steal and dunk with 1:32 remaining that put the Vols up 64-62. Tennessee has won its first 10 games in a season for the first time in 25 years. Jakucionis scored 22 points for Illinois (7-3). Tre White had 11 points and Kylan Boswell and Will Riley added 10 apiece. Tennessee led 31-30 at halftime and finished 20 of 28 from the line. Illinois hit 30 of 36 free throw tries.

      "2024-12-18 - Tennessee: 84 vs Western Carolina: 36\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Chaz Lanier scored 19 points to lead No. 1 Tennessee to an 84-36 victory over Western Carolina on Tuesday night. The Volunteers (11-0) tied for the third-best start in program history. Jordan Gainey scored 17, Darlinstone Dubar added 13 points and Zakai Zeigler just missed a triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists. The Catamounts (3-7), who struggled offensively after leading 9-3 in the first few minutes of the game, were led by Bernard Pelote with 10 points. Takeaways Western Carolina: Early season lopsided losses to Florida State and Marquette, and an impressive showing against Wake Forest, didn\u2019t help prepare the Catamounts for the buzzsaw they ran into in Knoxville. The start of the Southern Conference season against Furman on New Year\u2019s Day will be welcomed. Tennessee: Defense is a priority for Tennessee. The Vols have set 64 points as their defensive goal. So far, they have kept opponents at or under that mark nine of 11 times.

Wagner had 17 points and Boogie Fland 12 for Arkansas (11-3, 0-1). Takeaways Arkansas: Freshman guard Karter Knox has been the \u201cX\u201d factor for the Razorbacks so far this season.

Kelly\u2019s 3-pointer off a feed from Broome turned a two-point deficit into a one-point lead. Tennessee had a chance to take the lead in the final seconds, but a 3-point try the Vols' Zakai Zeigler missed the mark. Broome, a 6-foot-10, 240-pound fifth-year senior and preseason Associated Press All-American, back in action for the first time since suffering what coach Bruce Pearl called a \"significant sprain\u201d to his left ankle two weeks ago in a road win at South Carolina, secured crucial defensive rebounds on Tennessee\u2019s final two possessions.

Tennessee scored the last 11 points of the first half and led 33-30 at the break. The Vols had a scare when Zeigler went down with a knee injury, but he returned for the second half. Takeaways Kentucky: Heading into SEC play, Kentucky was one of the better teams in the country at taking care of the basketball. However, in recent games, the Wildcats have had their problems with double-digit turnovers. Injuries have played a role in the frustration, but Kentucky needs to stabilize the situation.

He has scored in double figures in five of the last eight games and has proven to be productive as a rebounder. Carey was instrumental in igniting the Vanderbilt offense early against Tennessee. Tennessee: Last year, Dalton Knecht was good enough to help the Vols through the games in which shots weren\u2019t falling. The 2022-23 and this season have been more challenging.

Jordan Gainey made a 3-pointer with 3:33 to left to give Tennessee (22-5, 9-5 Southeastern Conference) a 63-59 lead. Zakai Zeigler hit a 3 in front of the Vols' bench on an inbound pass with 21 seconds remaining to seal the victory. The Aggies (20-7, 9-5) started the game with three consecutive dunks before the Vols finally scored a little more than three minutes into the raucous setting at Reed Arena. A&M led 17-8 early before the Vols scored the next seven points to climb back in the game. Wade Taylor IV led the Aggies with 18 points, despite missing all nine of his 3-point attempts. Takeaways Texas A&M: The Aggies were coming off a 16-point loss at No. 21 Mississippi State that snapped a five-game winning streak, and they\u2019ve lost two straight games for the first time since mid-January (at home against Alabama and at Kentucky). A&M, despite failing to collect its first home victory against a top-10 opponent in program history, likely won\u2019t be affected much in the NCAA Tournament seedings. Tennessee: The Volunteers hadn\u2019t played since an 81-76 home victory over Vanderbilt a week earlier, and the rested crew appeared to have more energy and spirit from the start against the Aggies. Key moment The Aggies led 40-38 with 15:27 remaining when Tennessee's Jahmai Mashack collected an acrobatic, improbable tip-in while trying to grab the rebound off a Gainey missed 3-pointer. Key stat Both teams made 90% of their free throws, each hitting 18 of 20. Up next The Volunteers play at LSU on Tuesday night. The Aggies host Vanderbilt on Wednesday night. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-02-26 - LSU: 59 vs Tennessee: 65\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- \u2014 Zakai Zeigler scored 17 points, Felix Okpara added 15 and No. 5 Tennessee defeated LSU 65-59 on Tuesday night. Chaz Lanier added 14 points and a season-high nine rebounds for the Volunteers (23-5, 10-5 Southeastern Conference), who struggled offensively in the first half but built a 15-point lead on Cade Phillips' free throw with 3:24 left. By the time LSU (14-14, 3-12) trimmed Tennessee's lead down to 64-59, just 11 seconds remained. Vyctorius Miller scored 17 points and Cam Carter had 12 for LSU, which lost its second straight game against a team ranked in the top five. Takeaways Tennessee: The Volunteers have won six of seven, four of those by single digits. Tennessee outscored LSU 32-20 in the paint. LSU: With hustling perimeter defense and active hands, LSU kept most of the game competitive by holding the Volunteers 4.4% below their usual shooting average of 45.4% and well below their scoring average of 74.7 points this season. The Tigers just couldn't shoot well enough to pull off the kind of SEC stunner that Georgia had against No. 3 Florida earlier in the evening. Key moment After Zeigler hit a driving floater off the glass as he was fouled, he missed his free throw, but Okpara put back the rebound to make it 51-42 with eight minutes left. Tennessee pulled away from there. Key stat Tennessee outrebounded LSU 44-28 and converted 17 offensive rebounds into 27 second-chance points. Up next Both teams play Saturday.

      "2025-03-01 - Tennessee: 79 vs Alabama: 76\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Jahmai Mashack raced up the court and hit a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc at the buzzer to give No. 5 Tennessee a 79-76 victory over No. 6 Alabama on Saturday. The Volunteers (24-5, 11-5 Southeastern Conference) got the final shot by forcing a five-second inbounds violation under Alabama's basket with 3.8 seconds left. Chaz Lanier and Jordan Gainey each scored 18 points for Tennessee. Zakai Zeigler had 15, and Mashack finished with 11. Mark Sears led Alabama (23-6, 12-4) with 24 points. Labaron Philan had 13, and Aden Holloway added 11. Sears had 12 points in the first half to help Alabama take a 42-38 lead. Takeaways Alabama: It was a bold move for coach Nate Oats to re-work the framework of his team late in the season. Over the last four games, the Crimson Tide have gone to a three-guard starting lineup \u2014 inserting Labaron Philon along with Mark Sears and Chris Youngblood, while bringing Jarin Stevenson off the bench. The creative move has been successful so far. Tennessee: Big man Felix Okpara is becoming more involved in the offense. Coming into the Alabama game, he scored at least eight points in five of the last seven games and was in double figures three of those. Key moment With 3.8 seconds to play, Tennessee got the ball back on Alabama's inbounds violation. Key stat Alabama outrebounded the Vols 24-14 in the final 20 minutes, with a 13-7 advantage on the offensive end. Up next Both teams are in action Wednesday night.

Brakefield rebounded a missed 3-pointer from Sean Pedulla and fought through traffic inside to convert the decisive layup. Malik Dia and Dre Davis had 13 points apiece for Ole Miss (21-9, 10-7 Southeastern Conference), and Matthew Murrell added 12. The Rebels are 5-0 in games decided by four points or fewer since late January. Tennessee (24-6, 11-6) had an opportunity in the last few seconds, but a short running jumper by Igor Milicic Jr. bounced off the rim. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak. Jordan Gainey scored 17 points, Chaz Lanier had 15 and Felix Okpara added 13 points and seven rebounds for the Volunteers. Tennessee led 41-36 at halftime and 56-49 with 10:38 left before Ole Miss rallied. Takeaways Tennessee: One more win ensures a double bye in the SEC Tournament. But this loss could hurt Tennessee's chances at a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Mississippi: In his second season, coach Chris Beard\u2019s team has built an impressive resume.

The Volunteers (25-6, 12-6 Southeastern Conference) wrapped up a double bye for the SEC Tournament. Cade Phillips came off the bench to score 15 points, Igor Milicic had 13 and Jordan Gainey added 10 points. Jamarii Thomas scored 20 to lead the Gamecocks (12-19, 2-16).

Thomas had 14 points and the score was tied at 34 at halftime. Takeaways South Carolina: The Gamecocks, who have struggled until lately, have won two of their last five games to close out the season after going winless in their first 13 league games. Tennessee: The Vols have experienced some lapses in focus late in the season and needs to avoid that in the SEC and NCAA tournaments.

Tre Johnson had 11. Tennessee led 41-38 at halftime, then jumped out to a 65-50 lead halfway through the second against a team playing its third game in as many days. Takeaways Texas: The Longhorns came to Nashville having lost four of their last five. They won their first two games in a desperate bid to fight their win into NCAA Tournament, and boost coach Rodney Terry, whose job status after this season remains uncertain.

The fourth-seeded Volunteers (27-6) got revenge both for their Jan. 25 loss at Auburn and their 2019 loss to the Tigers in this tournament's title game. Tennessee will play fourth-ranked Florida, a 104-82 winner over No. 5 Alabama, on Sunday for the tournament title. The Vols and the winner of that semifinal likely wind up with No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament \u2014 only fitting for the nation\u2019s best league. Jordan Gainey added 15 points for the Vols, and Chaz Lanier had 12. The Tigers (28-5) go home losers of three of their last four games. SEC player of the year Johni Broome led Auburn with 23 points, Miles Kelly added 13 and Denver Jones had 10. Auburn led 33-32 at halftime thanks to a late 10-0 spurt. The Tigers last led at 48-47.

    "profile_summary": "Tennessee enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 2-seed with a 30-8 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine elite-level wins, a historically strong start (14-0, best in program history), and a defense that has been among the nation's best all season. Against ranked opponents, the Volunteers went approximately 10-8, with marquee wins over then-No. 13 Baylor (77-62, neutral), No. 23 Arkansas (76-52), No. 5 Florida (64-44, at home without Zeigler and Milicic), No. 6 Alabama on a Mashack buzzer-beater (79-76), No. 7 Texas A&M (77-69, road), No. 1 Auburn (70-65, neutral), and No. 6 Tennessee's signature moment was repeatedly beating quality teams in multiple environments \u2014 though losses to Florida (73-43, a 30-point road demolition), Kentucky twice (78-73 and 75-64), Auburn (53-51, road), Vanderbilt (76-75, road), Ole Miss (78-76, road), and Florida again in the SEC title game (86-77) reveal a team that consistently struggles away from Knoxville. The Vols closed the regular season and conference tournament on a mixed but intriguing run: wins over Vanderbilt (81-76 comeback from 16 down), Texas A&M (77-69), LSU (65-59), Alabama on a buzzer-beater (79-76), and South Carolina (75-65), before dropping the regular season finale at Ole Miss (78-76) and the SEC championship to Florida (86-77) \u2014 a 4-2 stretch that is encouraging in its competitiveness but concerning in its inability to close out close games on the road or neutral sites. In the SEC Tournament, however, Tennessee was genuinely impressive: they dismantled Texas (83-72), upset No. 3 Auburn in the semis (70-65) behind Zakai Zeigler's 20 points and a brilliant free-throw performance (25-of-27 as a team), before running out of gas against a rested Florida squad in the final.\n\nTennessee's identity is built around suffocating defense \u2014 they set a 64-point defensive benchmark and held opponents under it nine of eleven times early in the season \u2014 combined with a dangerous three-point attack led by Chaz Lanier, who has erupted for 25, 26, 29, 30, and 23 points in various games and shoots with the kind of volume and efficiency that can single-handedly torch opponents (7-of-10 from three against Baylor in the Baha Mar Championship). Senior point guard Zakai Zeigler is the engine \u2014 a career 600-assist, 200-steal distributor who scores, orchestrates, and competes in the biggest moments, evidenced by his SEC semifinal performance against Auburn. Igor Milicic Jr. provides a versatile frontcourt presence with rebounding and scoring upside, while Jordan Gainey has emerged as a reliable secondary creator and Jahmai Mashack delivered one of the season's most memorable shots with his half-court buzzer-beater against Alabama. The roster is thin \u2014 only nine scholarship players, with J.P. Estrella lost for the season to injury and Cameron Carr having departed \u2014 which raises real stamina and depth concerns over a six-game tournament run. Notably, Tennessee is 16-2 at home, 4-5 on the road, and has performed well on neutral sites (Baha Mar Championship title, two SEC Tournament wins over ranked opponents), suggesting the neutral-site NCAA Tournament environment suits them better than true road environments. The Vols are at their best when playing composed, defensive-minded basketball with Lanier running hot from three \u2014 and at their worst when shots are cold on the road and opponents attack their paint. Tennessee's realistic ceiling is the Elite Eight: they have the defensive backbone, star power, big-game experience, and neutral-site credibility to make a serious run, but their offensive inconsistency, thin rotation, and vulnerability in close games against elite competition make a Final Four appearance a high bar rather than an expectation.",

    "profile_summary": "Wofford enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 15-seed with a 19-16 record \u2014 a modest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a team that spent much of the season fighting for relevance before catching fire at the right moment. The Terriers' schedule told a brutal early story: a 51-point demolition at the hands of #6 Duke (86-35) in November exposed real limitations against elite competition, and non-conference losses to Lipscomb, Presbyterian, Milwaukee, and Portland State painted a picture of a team prone to vulnerability against mid-major peers. Against ranked opponents, Wofford went 0-1, with that Duke blowout standing as the only measurable data point \u2014 hardly encouraging big-game pedigree. In Southern Conference play, however, Wofford proved legitimately competitive, finishing 10-8 in league play and earning the sixth seed heading into the conference tournament. Their final five regular-season and tournament games tell the most compelling story: a 90-67 road blowout of Western Carolina, a narrow 78-75 home loss to Furman on a buzzer-beating three, followed by tournament wins over East Tennessee State (72-60), VMI (85-65), and a stunning 92-85 championship victory over Furman \u2014 avenging that late-game gut-punch and clinching the automatic bid. That three-game tournament surge, including outscoring opponents by a combined 44 points, represents genuine momentum.\n\nThe engine driving Wofford is a multi-headed offensive attack anchored by Corey Tripp, who has been the team's most reliable performer all season \u2014 dropping 31 points against ETSU in late February, 20 in the Citadel overtime win, and consistent double-figure contributions throughout league play. Kyler Filewich is a load inside, routinely posting double-doubles (16 points and 11 rebounds in the regular-season finale against Furman; 18 points and 11 rebounds against VMI in the championship run) and providing a physical presence few mid-major opponents can match. Dillon Bailey and Jackson Sivills offer reliable secondary scoring, with Sivills contributing 17 points in the tournament quarterfinal win over ETSU. The Terriers play a high-scoring, guard-and-post complementary style that can erupt offensively \u2014 they topped 80 points six times \u2014 but are equally capable of flat, disengaged performances; the Elon loss (56 points), VMI home loss (67 points), and early non-conference stumbles illustrate a team that is inconsistent rather than reliably locked in. Locationally, Wofford was strong at home but showed they can win on the road and at neutral sites when playing with confidence, as evidenced by their tournament run in Asheville. The squad projects as scrappy and resilient \u2014 capable of clutch moments (Tripp's regulation-tying free throws against The Citadel, the Furman championship comeback) \u2014 but the Duke blowout and early non-conference stumbles make it hard to envision them sustaining that energy against a high-major opponent. **Verdict: Wofford is a near-certain first-round exit.** A 19-16 record, zero wins against ranked opponents, and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built almost entirely on mid-major competition makes them a feel-good story with a hard ceiling \u2014 a dangerous underdog for 40 minutes, but realistically overmatched against any competent high-major 2-seed.",

      "2024-11-05 - Kansas: 87 vs Howard: 57\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 Zeke Mayo, a grad transfer from South Dakota State, had 19 points in his Kansas debut and the top-ranked Jayhawks beat Howard 87-57 on Monday night in the season-opener for both teams. Kansas led 46-19 at halftime and its biggest lead was 38 points. The game was the second annual McClendon Classic, named in honor of Kansas graduate and Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame honoree John McClendon. Kansas (1-0) used the game as a tune-up before a top-10 showdown with North Carolina on Friday night. The Jayhawks had 10 players score, with three in double-figures. Hunter Dickinson, who missed Kansas' scrimmage and exhibition games, had 16 points and six rebounds, and Flory Bidunga added 13 points and a game-high eight rebounds. Blake Harper had 16 points to lead Howard. Takeaways Howard: The Bison will take away plenty from the contest, mostly measured in guaranteed money they received from Kansas. Kansas: The Jayhawks won their 52nd consecutive home opener, dating back to the final 10 years of Ted Owens\u2019 career, through five years under Larry Brown, 15 under Roy Williams and 22 straight under Bill Self. Key moment After falling behind 4-3 early, the Jayhawks used a 12-3 run to eliminate any thoughts of a Howard victory. Howard went almost nine minutes without a field goal, missing 10 straight shot attempts as Kansas methodically pulled away. Key stat Howard shot just 24.1 percent (7 for 29) in the first half.

      "2024-11-09 - Kansas: 92 vs North Carolina: 89\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 Hunter Dickinson had 20 points for top-ranked Kansas, which blew a 20-point first-half lead against No. 9 North Carolina before holding on for a 92-89 victory when the Tar Heels\u2019 Elliot Cadeau missed a 3-pointer as time expired Friday night. Zeke Mayo had 21 points and KJ Adams Jr had 14 for the Jayhawks (2-0), who led 49-29 in the first half but trailed 87-83 with 3:28 to go. Dickinson and Mayo responded with a series of baskets to tie the game at 89, and Dickinson\u2019s basket with 1:15 to go and free throw with 12 seconds remaining made it a three-point game. The Tar Heels (1-1) raced up the floor, but Cadeau\u2019s 3 from the wing never had a chance. Seth Trimble scored 19 points to lead North Carolina. RJ Davis had 16 points and Cadeau finished with 12. It was just the 13th matchup of the Tar Heels and Jayhawks, and the first since Kansas rallied from a 16-point deficit to win the 2022 national championship. The only other time they have met on campus was in 1960, when Larry Brown \u2014 who would later coach the Jayhawks to the 1988 title \u2014 helped the Tar Heels win in Allen Fieldhouse. Kansas made a repeat seem unlikely when it built a 20-point first-half lead. But the Tar Heels trimmed the deficit in the second half, and Jae'Lyn Withers' 3-pointer gave them an 80-79 lead with 7:06 to go. The two bluebloods wrestled it away several other times before Kansas finally put the game away. Takeaways North Carolina stayed alive by getting to the basket and drawing fouls, ultimately going 28 of 31 from the line. Kansas avoided what would have been the biggest blown-lead loss in school history while giving coach Bill Self his 590th win at the school, matching Phog Allen's record. Key moment Dickinson's basket inside with 1:15 left gave Kansas the lead, and the All-American center's free throw forced North Carolina into needing a 3-pointer to tie the game. Key stat 20 \u2014 The lead that Kansas had in the first half. And that the Tar Heels overcame in the second. Up next North Carolina plays American next Friday night.

      "2024-11-12 - Kansas: 77 vs Michigan State: 69\n\nATLANTA -- \u2014 Hunter Dickinson scored 28 points and Bill Self became the winningest coach in Kansas history as the top-ranked Jayhawks pulled away from Michigan State for a 77-69 victory in the Champions Classic on Tuesday night. Spartans forward Jaxon Kohler hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 52 with just under nine minutes remaining. KJ Adams Jr. hit a pair of free throws to put Kansas (3-0) ahead to stay. Self improved to 591-143 in his 22nd season coaching the Jayhawks, pushing him past Phog Allen's mark of 590-219 in 39 seasons on the Kansas sideline. Frankie Fidler led Michigan State (2-1) with 15 points. The Jayhawks posted their second straight win over one of the nation's prominent programs, following up a 92-89 win over No. 10 North Carolina. Takeaways Kansas: After missing 15 straight shots from the field, Kansas ripped off a 14-2 run that turned an 18-16 deficit into a 30-20 lead. Michigan State: The Spartans couldn't overcome a tough shooting night, especially from beyond the arc. They made just 3 of 24 from 3-point range. Key moment Dajuan Harris Jr. gave the Jayhawks some breathing room when he laid one in off a fast break, drew a foul and completed the three-point play for a 68-59 lead with 4:25 to go. After tumbling to the court, Harris remained on his back for a few seconds, clapping furiously. He finished with 11 points and six assists. Key stats The 7-foot-2 Dickinson made 13 of 21 shots from the field, including his only 3-point attempt, and grabbed 12 rebounds. He also had three steals and a block at the defensive end.

      "2024-11-16 - Kansas: 78 vs Oakland: 57\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 AJ Storr had a season-high 16 points off the bench and three starters also reached double figures as No. 1 Kansas easily handled Oakland 78-57 on Saturday. KJ Adams scored 10 of his 12 points in the first half, Rylan Griffen added 11 and Hunter Dickinson finished with 10. Dickinson led the Jayhawks with nine rebounds. Kansas (4-0) pulled away methodically in the first half, leading by 22 at halftime. The Grizzlies never got closer than 18 in the second half. Kansas played the final 4:32 with only reserves in the game. Allen Mukeba led Oakland (1-3) with 19 points, and Tuburu Naivalurua added 12. Oakland struggled from 3-point range, shooting 6 of 23 (27%), and was woeful at the free-throw line (3 for 12). Takeaways Oakland: The Grizzlies were no match for Kansas inside during the first half, when the game was decided. They were outrebounded 20-12 and outscored 26-14 in the paint. Kansas: The Jayhawks have too much depth for a mid-major program like Oakland to overcome. The Jayhawks got points from 11 players. They had 36 bench points, compared to 17 for Oakland. Key moments Dickinson hit a floater in the lane at the 4:37 mark of the first half to give Kansas a 34-17 cushion. Griffen made a baseline 3 just before the buzzer, and the Jayhawks took a 46-24 lead into the locker room. Key stats DaJuan Harris scored only two points in 23 minutes, but he had six assists and just one turnover. He was tenacious on defense, with four steals \u2014 including three in the first few minutes of the second half when Kansas eliminated any thoughts of an Oakland comeback.

      "2024-11-20 - Kansas: 84 vs UNC Wilmington: 66\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 Hunter Dickinson had 15 points and 15 rebounds, Dajuan Harris Jr. scored 16 points, and No. 1 Kansas shrugged off a sluggish start to beat UNC Wilmington 84-66 on Tuesday night and give Jayhawks coach Bill Self his 800th career win. David Coit added 13 points and Zeke Mayo had 10 for the Jayhawks (5-0), who led 43-38 at halftime before going on a 12-2 run to start the second half. They stretched the lead to 20 and coasted to their 18th straight nonconference home win. The Jayhawks next face No. 12 Duke in the Vegas Showdown on Tuesday. Khamari McGriff had 18 points and Noah Ross had 10 with nine boards for UNC Wilmington (4-1), which was picked to finish third in the Colonial Athletic Association after winning 21 games last season. The Seahawks weren't intimidated by the 372nd straight sellout at Allen Fieldhouse. They beat Kentucky at Rupp Arena just last season. And while Kansas started the game with energy, UNC Wilmington matched it for the first 20 minutes. It wasn't until Harris led the Jayhawks' early second-half charge that they put the game away. Takeaways UNC Wilmington got just seven points from Donovan Newby. He had 20 in a recent win over USC Upstate. Kansas lost freshman Flory Bidunga to an injury in the first half. He did not put any weight on his right leg as he was helped to the bench. He did not return. Bidunga's loss would be a big blow to the Jayhawks' interior depth. Key moment Kansas roared out of halftime on the run that ultimately decided the game. Key stats The Jayhawks won despite shooting 6 of 25 from 3-point range. Up Next The Seahawks play Colgate on Nov. 27. The Jayhawks play the Blue Devils on Tuesday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2024-11-27 - Duke: 72 vs Kansas: 75\n\nLAS VEGAS -- \u2014 Dajuan Harris scored 14 points and top-ranked Kansas withstood the ejection of star center Hunter Dickinson to beat No. 11 Duke 75-72 in the Vegas Showdown on Tuesday night. Dickinson, who entered the game averaging 17.8 points and 10.4 rebounds, received a fragrant-2 foul and was ejected for kicking the Blue Devils\u2019 Maliq Brown in the head midway through the second half. Highly touted Duke freshman Cooper Flagg took advantage of Dickinson's absence, and the Blue Devils kept it close all the way to the buzzer. Zeke Mayo added 12 points for Kansas (6-0), and Dickinson and AJ Storr each scored 11. Tyrese Proctor led Duke (4-2) with 15 points, Flagg scored 13, Kon Knueppel had 11 and Sion James finished with 10. Mayo put Kansas ahead for good when he made a jumper with 1:57 left for a 73-71 lead. Flagg hit a free throw for Duke and Rylan Griffen answered with two foul shots with 2 seconds left. Kansas has won four of the past five meetings with the Blue Devils and six of eight. Nine of the past 10 meetings have been decided by single digits. Takeaways Kansas: Overcoming the loss of Dickinson could serve the Jayhawks well later in the season. Duke: Flagg had six points when Dickinson went out, but then on four trips to the lane had two dunks, a layup and a free throw. Key moment Knueppel had a 3-point try rim out at the buzzer that would have forced overtime. Key stat Duke shot 50% from the field and 42.3% from 3-point range. Kansas shot 49.1% overall and 47.1% from 3. Up next Kansas hosts Furman on Saturday. Duke is home against Seattle on Friday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-30 - Kansas: 86 vs Furman: 51\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- \u2014 KJ Adams matched a career-high 22 points and No. 1 Kansas used a 30-9 run at the end of the first half and the beginning of the second to beat Furman 86-51 on Saturday night. Hunter Dickinson had 10 points and six rebounds for the Jayhawks (7-0), who handled the trap game nestled between last week's win over No. 11 Duke in Las Vegas and next week's trip to No. 21 Creighton for the Big 12-Big East Battle. The Jayhawks and Paladins (7-1) began the day as two of 23 unbeatens left in men's Division I basketball. Kansas led just 27-26 before Flory Bidunga's basket completed a 12-2 run to end the first half. The charge continued in the second, and Adams eventually converted a three-point play to give the Jayhawks a 57-35 lead with 13 1/2 minutes to go. Eddrin Bronson scored 14 points and Garrett Hien had 12 points for the Paladins. Takeaways Furman: The Paladins are seventh nationally in 3s per game, and they knocked down four of their first seven to hang around.

Perhaps appropriately, the play of the half came off courtesy of the Kansas defense: Dajuan Harris Jr. corralled a loose ball with a baseball slide near the sideline and passed to Dickinson, who in turn got the ball to David Coit running up floor. He threw an alley-oop from the midcourt line that KJ Adams slammed down to an enormous roar from a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd. Kansas never allowed the Cyclones to make a big second-half run and get back in the game. Takeaways Iowa State's biggest problem right now is on offense. The Cyclones managed just 75 points in an overtime loss at Arizona and 61 in last weekend's lopsided home loss to Kansas State. Kansas proved it could hold off a Big 12 foe after building a big lead at halftime. The Jayhawks similarly led Baylor 40-21 at the break last weekend but was outscored 60-30 over the final 20 minutes for an 81-70 loss. Key moment The Cyclones had closed to 64-49 with 3:25 left when Mayo used a jab step to get open for a 3-pointer. It not only extended the Kansas lead but wiped away any momentum that Iowa State had built. Key stat Iowa State finished 3 of 21 from beyond the 3-point arc. Up next Iowa State plays TCU on Saturday.

    "profile_summary": "Kansas enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 7-seed with a 21-13 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a team of genuine talent that never fully put it together for a sustained stretch. Against ranked opponents, the Jayhawks went 6-9, with notable wins over #9 North Carolina, #11 Duke, #11 Michigan State, #8 Iowa State, and #24 Arizona, but damaging losses to Creighton (unranked at the time), Missouri (unranked), #2 Iowa State, #7 Houston (twice), #10 Texas Tech, and others. In the final five games of available summaries \u2014 a 96-64 demolition of Oklahoma State, a gutsy 71-64 road win at Colorado behind Hunter Dickinson's 32 points, a 73-78 home loss to Texas Tech that featured another Kansas collapse after tying the game late, a 59-65 road loss at #3 Houston in a competitive but ultimately losing effort, an 83-76 home win over #24 Arizona fueled by Dickinson's career-high-matching 33 points and five Mayo threes, and a Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal loss to Arizona 88-77 \u2014 Kansas looks like a team that is dangerous and maddening in equal measure: capable of beating anyone on a given night, yet persistently unable to impose its will consistently. The Jayhawks are defined by the Hunter Dickinson-Zeke Mayo tandem; Dickinson is posting double-doubles at will (15 on the season), with a peak that includes back-to-back elite performances of 32 and 33 points to close the regular season, while Mayo provides perimeter firepower and clutch shot-making, most recently erupting for 20 points on five threes against Arizona. KJ Adams Jr. offers a reliable third option when healthy, though his partially separated shoulder mid-season created real interior depth concerns alongside freshman Flory Bidunga's injury absences. Kansas plays an identity-shifting style \u2014 at its best, it wins with a dominant interior presence, sharp ball movement (14 assists against one first-half turnover versus Arizona), and lockdown second-half defense; at its worst, it hemorrhages turnovers (22 against Missouri, 20 forced by Houston), collapses under full-court pressure (the historic 21-point blown lead at Baylor), and disappears offensively for long stretches. The Jayhawks are a markedly better team at home \u2014 winning 42 consecutive home finales and posting dominant results in Allen Fieldhouse \u2014 but have been inconsistent and frequently outworked on the road, losing at Creighton, Missouri, Iowa State, Utah, and BYU by a combined margin that suggests genuine road fragility. In a neutral-site tournament environment, the early-season Champions Classic wins over North Carolina and Michigan State indicate this group can elevate for big moments, though the Big 12 Tournament exit to Arizona at a neutral site introduces doubt. The bottom line: Kansas is a genuinely dangerous 7-seed \u2014 Dickinson at his peak is an elite-level force, Mayo can get hot from three at any moment, and this team has the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 wins to prove it can compete with anyone \u2014 but the chronic inconsistency, turnover issues, collapse-prone tendencies, and road struggles make a run beyond the Sweet 16 a tall order. **Realistic tournament ceiling: Sweet 16**, with a credible upset threat in the first two rounds and the talent to surprise, but too prone to self-destruction to project deeper with confidence.",

      "2024-11-07 - Arkansas: 76 vs Lipscomb: 60\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- \u2014 John Calipari won his debut as Arkansas coach when the 16th-ranked Razorbacks held off a second-half rally by Lipscomb and pulled away for a 76-60 victory Wednesday night. Freshman guard Boogie Fland scored 17 points and Florida Atlantic transfer Johnell Davis added 15 for Arkansas. Calipari, who left Southeastern Conference rival Kentucky after last season, had previously been booed incessantly whenever stepping foot in Bud Walton Arena. That all changed when Eric Musselman, who coached Arkansas to three Sweet 16s in five seasons, departed last spring and Calipari bolted from the bluegrass of Kentucky for the foothills of the Ozarks. His new team looked a lot like his old ones. Lipscomb (1-1), the Atlantic Sun preseason favorite, put a scare into the Razorbacks (1-0) with a second-half run to pull within four points with just under seven minutes to play. Arkansas had led by 15 in the second half. Zvonimir Ivisic, one of seven players to make their Razorbacks debut Wednesday, hit a 3-pointer, a layup and two free throws in the span of a minute to stop the Bisons. Ivisic finished with 12 points. Jacob Ognacevic led Lipscomb with 16. Takeaways Lipscomb: The Bisons put up enough of a fight to suggest their projection as A-Sun champions is not farfetched. Arkansas: The Razorbacks might be as deep as any team in the country and the statistical totals backed that up. Calipari & Co. will need time to coalesce, but the team looks to be as dangerous as expected. Key moment Arkansas closed the first half on a 10-2 run to build a 39-28 lead at halftime. Key stats Arkansas outscored the Bisons 23-5 on fast-break points and 54-24 in the paint. The Razorbacks shot 68% inside the 3-point line, offsetting a 4-of-19 performance from beyond the arc. Up next Lipscomb hosts Wofford on Saturday. Arkansas gets its first power-conference challenge of the season Saturday when the Razorbacks travel to Dallas for a neutral-site game against No. 8 Baylor, which is coming off a 101-63 loss at No. 6 Gonzaga. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-10 - Arkansas: 67 vs Baylor: 72\n\nDALLAS -- \u2014 Jayden Nunn had 16 points while Norchad Omier had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds as eighth-ranked Baylor bounced back from a season-opening blowout loss and held on to beat No. 16 Arkansas 72-67 on Saturday night. The Bears (1-1) never trailed five nights after their 101-63 loss to sixth-ranked Gonzaga. There were three ties in their second game, and Nunn hit go-ahead baskets each time. His 3-pointer with 15:46 left put them ahead to stay. Arkansas (1-1) was within 70-67 when freshman Boogie Fland, who finished with 17 points and seven assists, hit a long 3-pointer with 24 seconds left. Baylor then managed to break the press and freshman V.J. Edgecombe made two free throws. Adou Thiero, among four transfers who came with new Razorbacks coach John Calipari from Kentucky, had 24 points on 10-for-15 shooting in the matchup of former Southwest Conference rivals at the home of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. Jeremy Roach added 13 points for Baylor, while Edgecombe had 11 and Robert Wright 10. Takeaways Arkansas: This game was a significant step-up in competition for the Razorbacks, who played six transfers and three freshmen. They had opened with a win over Lipscomb. Baylor: The Bears are the only team to face Top 25 teams in each of its first two games. Key moment After Thiero scored the first six points after halftime, the start of an 11-2 Razorbacks run to tie the score at 44, Nunn hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key on an assist from Edgecombe. Arkansas then missed a shot that Edgecombe rebounded and followed with a 3 of his own. Key stat Baylor led for 38:07 in the game, though Arkansas had the biggest run. Up next Baylor host Sam Houston on Tuesday night, and Arkansas host Troy on Wednesday to open a stretch of four straight at home. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season.

Thiero was 8 for 10 from the field as Arkansas (3-1) shot 60% as a team. Boogie Fland scored 20 points, and Zvonimir Ivisic finished with 15. D.J. Wagner had 14 points and five assists. Pacific (3-3) lingered until the final 12 minutes, pulling within two at one juncture. But the Tigers went more than eight minutes without a field goal and Arkansas kept building its lead. Takeaways Pacific: It was one of the Tigers' best games of the season, but they have lost three in a row. Elijah Fisher scored 23 points. Arkansas: The new-look Razorbacks, in coach John Calipari\u2019s first season, are finding an offensive rhythm even with only one scholarship player returning from last year. Key moment Lamar Washington's three-point play trimmed Pacific's deficit to 59-57 with 12:57 remaining. But Wagner responded with a layup for Arkansas. Johnell Davis' 3-pointer lifted the Razorbacks to a 66-59 lead with 11:53 to go. Key stat Arkansas shot 43% (9 for 21) from 3-point range and 80% (20 for 25) from the free-throw line. Pacific made only two of its last 16 shots from the field, shooting 32% in the second half after almost 50% shooting in the first. Up next Pacific will play a second straight SEC team Friday when it travels to Missouri.

      "2024-11-23 - Arkansas: 79 vs Little Rock: 67\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- \u2014 Adou Thiero scored 23 points, and Boogie Fland added another 21 to lead No. 20 Arkansas to a 79-67 win over Little Rock on Friday night. Thiero scored 16 of his 23 in the second half to put the Trojans away after they cut Arkansas\u2019 lead to seven points. The Razorbacks never trailed and improved to 4-1 under Hall of Fame coach John Calipari. Along with Thiero's second half, Arkansas used a 7-0 run to keep Little Rock at bay. DJ Wagner and Zvonimir Ivisic scored 11 and 10, respectively. Mwani Wilkinson led the Trojans with 18 points. Takeaways Little Rock: The Trojans were picked as preseason OVC favorites and largely looked the part against a power-conference foe before stumbling late. Arkansas: The Razorbacks are maintaining position as they near the toughest portion of their nonconference schedule. Arkansas will play No. 25 Illinois and Miami in back-to-back games around the Thanksgiving holiday. Key moment Arkansas went on a 7-0 run just as Little Rock cut the lead to seven points in the second half. Key stat The Razorbacks were not good at holding on to the ball, committing 19 turnovers. The difference came on scoring off those miscues as Arkansas scored 28 points off Little Rock\u2019s 19 giveaways while the Trojans managed just 17 off the Razorbacks' mistakes. Up next Little Rock travels to Illinois on Monday, the same day Arkansas hosts Maryland-Eastern Shore. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Jakucionis hit two free throws to give Illinois a double-digit lead with 3:49 remaining in the game. Arkansas had a turnover and a missed jumper on its next two possessions and Jakucionis hit an open 3-pointer to make it 85-71 at 2:42. Kylan Boswell added 18 points for Illinois (6-1). Head coach Brad Underwood broke a tie with J. Craig Ruby (1922-36) for fifth place in program history with 149 wins. Adou Thiero went 12 of 21 from the line and scored 26 points for Arkansas (5-2). Zvonimir Ivisic had 13 points, six rebounds and two blocks. Takeaways Tomislav Ivisic won the battle against his twin brother, Zvonimir. Along with his double-double, Tomislav Ivisic made 6 of 9 3-pointers and blocked three shots.

Arkansas had beaten Kentucky, coach John Calipari\u2019s previous team, and Texas, the Razorbacks\u2019 oldest rival, to claw onto the NCAA Tournament bubble before Saturday\u2019s loss. Key stat Alabama simply made shots at a higher clip, 55% to Arkansas\u2019 43%. The Tide also got 31 bench points to the Razorbacks\u2019 11. Up next Alabama travels to Texas on Tuesday night.

The teams combined to hit seven of 43 3-point attempts. Takeaways Arkansas: The Razorbacks showed some early signs of life on offense, but they couldn\u2019t maintain their hot start from the field. John Calipari\u2019s team has struggled with scoring consistently in SEC play, and that continued Wednesday night. Auburn: This was not a clean game from Auburn, which had an uncharacteristically off performance in 3-point shooting, ball security and rim defense. While the Tigers tightened up later, Bruce Pearl\u2019s team has played much more complete games at home this season.

Pringle finished 7-for-11 shooting and along with Murray-Boyles made 19 of South Carolina's 25 made field goals. Karter Knox scored 11 points and reserve Jonas Aidoo 10 for the Razorbacks. Arkansas' final point total and margin of defeat may appear misleading. The Razorbacks didn't score 20 points until Billy Richmond III made a layup with 12:35 left in the game to reduce Arkansas' deficit to 47-20. Arkansas didn't reach double-digit figures in the scoring column until Aido made 1 of 2 foul shots with 2:24 left before halftime and the Razorbacks facing a 27-10 deficit. The Razorbacks finished shooting just 28.8% (15 for 52). South Carolina led 32-14 at intermission. It was the first time this century that an Arkansas team scored less than 15 points in a half.

A.J. Hoggard hit a 3-pointer that made it a six-point game 41 seconds into the second half but the Commodores got no closer. Tyler Nickel led Vanderbilt (20-10, 8-9) with 16 points and and Hoggard added 14 with seven assists. Devin McGlockton, who fouled out with almost five minutes to play, scored 12 and MJ Collins 10.

Mississippi State (20-11, 8-10 Southeastern Conference) used a 12-0 run to go up by one point with 3:14 to play, its first lead since before halftime.

DJ Wagner, who scored a game-high 24 points, gave the Razorbacks a three-point lead on a 3-pointer with 44 seconds left. But Jonathan Hubbard countered, hitting a 3-pointer for the Bulldogs just 10 seconds later to set up the frantic finish. Aidoo, a preseason second-team All-SEC selection, largely struggled in his first season with the Razorbacks after transferring from Tennessee. But he scored a season-high 21 points and had 10 rebounds in the regular-season finale. Claudell Harris Jr. led Mississippi State with 18 points and Hubbard finished with 17. Takeaways The Razorbacks entered the game likely on the right side of the NCAA Tournament bubble and should be breathing fine on Selection Sunday. Mississippi State should make the tournament, as well, but the Bulldogs have seen their seeding drop as they lost four of their last five games. Key moment Riley Kugel, who made the 3 that gave Mississippi State its first second-half lead, was blocked at the rim by Billy Richmond in the waning seconds. RJ Melendez grabbed the offensive rebound, but missed the putback as time expired. Key stats The Razorbacks shot well. They made 55% of their field goals, 43% of their 3-pointers and 81% of their free throws. The Bulldogs committed just two turnovers and scored 19 points off 10 Arkansas giveaways.

Arkansas forward Trevon Brazile was at the free-throw line with 7.4 seconds left after he was fouled going for an offensive rebound. He missed both free throws and Dre Davis grabbed the defensive rebound. Davis passed it ahead to Pedulla, who dribbled up the court for a shot well behind the arc for a go-ahead 3-pointer.

    "profile_summary": "Arkansas enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 10-seed with a 22-14 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on remarkable resilience and genuine big-game upside, but undercut by chronic inconsistency and a brutal 0-5 start to SEC play. Against ranked opponents, the Razorbacks went 5-10, with signature wins over #12 Kentucky (89-79 in Lexington), #15 Missouri (92-85), #8 Texas (78-70 on the road), and #14 Michigan (89-87 at Madison Square Garden) \u2014 victories that collectively validate their tournament credentials. However, blowout losses to #1 Tennessee (76-52), #23 Ole Miss (73-66 at home), and South Carolina (72-53 in a historically ugly first half) reveal a team capable of going completely flat without warning. Their final five games tell a story of streaky survival: a gutsy 93-92 home thriller over Mississippi State, a dominant 90-77 road win at Vanderbilt, a 72-53 demolition at the hands of South Carolina in which they didn't reach 15 first-half points, and then a narrow SEC Tournament win over South Carolina before bowing out on Sean Pedulla's buzzer-beating 3-pointer against Ole Miss \u2014 missing two free throws in the final seconds that would have closed the game. Stylistically, Arkansas is a team of explosive offensive runs and dangerous collapses: they can reel off 18-0 stretches one moment and go scoreless for 11-plus minutes the next, making them both exciting and terrifying to watch. The offensive engine runs through Adou Thiero (15.6 PPG, 55% shooter), who is nursing a knee injury that cost him the last three regular-season games and whose availability is the single biggest question mark entering the tournament, along with the dynamic duo of Johnell Davis \u2014 who delivered a season-high 24 points at Texas \u2014 and Zvonimir Ivisic, the 7-foot-2 sophomore who erupted for 27 against Alabama and 25 against LSU. Boogie Fland provides playmaking and clutch shot-making (the Miami comeback, the Michigan rally), while D.J. Wagner, Karter Knox, and Trevon Brazile give Arkansas the kind of depth that can overwhelm mid-major opponents. The Razorbacks play with unmistakable fight \u2014 they came back from 15 down against Georgia, erased a 14-point deficit against Texas in overtime, and rallied from 15 down against Michigan \u2014 but they are equally prone to jaw-dropping disengagement, as evidenced by allowing 21-6 opening runs against Illinois and 18-0 Missouri bursts. Location matters: Arkansas is measurably better at home (where they swept Texas, beat Missouri, and closed strong) and on neutral sites (the Michigan win, the Miami road finish), but have been consistently vulnerable on the road in hostile SEC venues. This is a dangerous, high-ceiling 10-seed with multiple ranked wins, a physically imposing frontcourt, and the offensive firepower to beat anyone on a given night \u2014 but Thiero's health, their free-throw unreliability in crunch time (Brazile's two missed FTs against Ole Miss being the defining image of this team's tournament fate), and their well-documented tendency to disappear for extended stretches make a Sweet 16 run the realistic ceiling, with a first-round upset entirely plausible and a second-round exit the most likely outcome.",

Johnson had five assists, including the pass to Benny Williams that helped put the Knights ahead 62-61 with 45.5 seconds left. The Aggies didn't score in the final 2:13. UCF fans stormed the court after Texas A&M missed back-to-back 3-pointers to end the game. Jordan Ivy-Curry added 16 points for UCF. Keyshawn Hall scored 10. Pharrel Payne led the Aggies with 15 points and had six rebounds. Wade Taylor IV had 13 points and seven assists but made only 4 of his 15 shots. Takeaways Texas A&M: Locked up the interior for most of the game, but foul trouble prevented the Aggies from pulling away. They committed 17 fouls in the second half, allowing the Knights to shoot 22 for 31 from the free-throw line in the game. UCF: Struggled to shoot most of the night but stayed in the game thanks to some timely 3-point shooting and, most importantly, defense. The Knights blocked 10 shots, including seven in the second half. Key moment Williams' slam put the Knights ahead for good on a night they struggled shooting on the interior. They finished with just 14 points in the paint. Key stat The Knights relied heavily on their 3-point shooting, making 8 for 26 in the game. Johnson made five 3-pointers. Texas A&M shot 7 for 23 from beyond the arc. Up next Texas A&M begins a four-game homestand on Friday against Texas A&M University-Commerce.

      "2024-11-09 - Texas A&M: 87 vs East Texas A&M: 55\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- \u2014 Zhuric Phelps scored 18 points in his Texas A&M debut, Manny Obaseki and Henry Coleman III each added 14 and the 13th-ranked Aggies beat East Texas A&M 87-55 on Friday night. Texas A&M (1-1) bounced back after losing at Central Florida on Monday in its season opener. Phelps, an SMU transfer, missed that game with a hand injury. Hayden Hefner added 13 points for Texas A&M and Wade Taylor had 10. The Aggies led 50-24 at halftime. Scotter Williams Jr. scored 12 points for East Texas A&M, which changed its name from Texas A&M-Commerce on Thursday. The Texas A&M University System Board of Regents voted to approve the new name. Takeaways East Texas A&M: The Lions\u2019 first game with their new name was forgettable, although facing a ranked team should help when they begin Southland Conference play in early December. The Lions wore \u201cEast Texas\u201d on their new jerseys. Texas A&M: The Aggies needed this one after falling 64-61 at Central Florida. Ten players saw at least 17 minutes of action against the Lions. The Aggies' nonconference schedule is one of the toughest in program history, but this wasn't one of those games. Key moment The Aggies led 12-7 a little more than four minutes into the game when Hefner drilled a 3-pointer to start building their big lead. Key stat The Aggies had a major height advantage and outscored the Lions 54-26 in the paint. Texas A&M nearly scored as many points inside as East Texas A&M managed overall.

Henry Coleman III added 13 points for the Aggies (2-1), who dropped 10 spots in the AP Top 25 poll this week. But they have won consecutive games over Lamar and East Texas A&M after opening the season with a 64-61 loss at UCF. Alexis Marmolejos led Lamar (1-1) with 23 points. Phelps is an SMU transfer who has led the Aggies in scoring in their last two games after missing the opener with a hand injury. Texas A&M shot 55.2% from the floor, including 12 for 26 (46%) from 3-point range, and sixth-year coach Buzz Williams earned his 350th career victory. He is 350-218 over 18 seasons. Takeaways Texas A&M: The Aggies will need faster starts in Southeastern Conference play this season. They were still in single digits more than five minutes into this one before finally heating up from the outside against their Southland Conference opponent. Lamar: The Cardinals\u2019 previous game was a 71-point home victory over Paul Quinn College on Nov. 4, which didn't really prepare Lamar for its road opener at an SEC opponent. After shooting 56.1% from the field against Paul Quinn, the Cardinals finished at 37.5% versus the Aggies. Key moment The Aggies led 35-25 with 5:20 remaining in the first half when A&M guard Jace Carter stole an inbounds pass and dribbled the length of the court for a layup. Texas A&M outscored the Cardinals 13-4 the rest of the half to open a 50-29 lead at the break. Key stat The hustling Aggies outrebounded the Cardinals 46-31, including 31-17 on the defensive end.

Zhuric Phelps added 14 points and Henry Coleman III chipped in 12 for the Aggies. The Aggies have won three consecutive games following a season-opening loss at UCF and handed the Buckeyes their first loss of the season. The Aggies led 31-22 at halftime before starting the second half with two 3-pointers from Phelps and Taylor to build a 37-22 lead. Bruce Thornton led the Buckeyes with 15 points, John Mobley Jr. added 13 and Ohio State shot 34% (20 of 59) from the field, compared to 39% (19 of 49) by the Aggies. Takeaways Ohio State: The Buckeyes made 24 3-pointers in their first two games but weren\u2019t nearly as effective from long range on Friday. They only went 5 of 17 (29%) in the first half and wound up 8 of 30 (27%) from the 3-point line. Texas A&M: The Aggies\u2019 subpar nonconference scheduling in the past has caught up with them in NCAA Tournament seeding but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem this season. Texas A&M got a Quad 1 victory with its win over Ohio State. Key moment Aggies guard Hayden Hefner grabbed a loose ball out of midair in front of the free-throw line and heaved a prayer that dropped through the basket, lifting the Aggies to a 27-17 lead with 2:41 remaining in the first half. Key stat The Aggies outscored the Buckeyes 16-9 in second-chance points. Up next The Buckeyes host Evansville on Tuesday night for their second home game of the season, and the Aggies stay at home on Wednesday night against Southern. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-26 - Oregon: 80 vs Texas A&M: 70\n\nLAS VEGAS -- \u2014 TJ Bamba had 18 points and Oregon scored the last 11 to defeat No. 20 Texas A&M 80-70 on Tuesday in the Players Era Festival. The Ducks (6-0) held Texas A&M (4-2) without a field goal over the final 4 1/2 minutes, allowing them to erase a 70-69 deficit. Brandon Angel and Jackson Shelstad each scored 16 points for Oregon, and Jadrian Tracey added 11. Zhuric Phelps led the Aggies with 20 points, and Wade Taylor IV finished with 15. Texas A&M led 58-48 before Oregon went on a nine-point run in 1:01 to cut the deficit to one with 8:10 left. The Ducks extended the spurt to 16 straight points, prompting two Aggies timeouts as Oregon grabbed a 64-58 lead. Then the game went back and forth before the Ducks closed on their game-ending 11-point run. Texas A&M forward Solomon Washington, who entered averaging 4.8 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, went down hard nearly midway through the first half and did not return.

Aderss Garcia added 13 and Henry Coleman III had 10 points and 13 rebounds.

    "profile_summary": "Texas A&M enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 4-seed with a 23-11 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on elite defense, dominant rebounding, and enough star power to beat anyone on a given night, but also carrying the scars of a late-season collapse that raises legitimate durability questions. Against ranked opponents, the Aggies went an impressive 9-8, with signature wins over No. 1 Auburn (83-72 at home), No. 11 Purdue (70-66 in Indianapolis), No. 17 Oklahoma on the road in a stunning 18-point comeback, No. 15 Missouri on a buzzer-beater Wade Taylor IV 3-pointer, and No. 21 Creighton at a neutral site \u2014 a collection of victories that confirms this team can compete at the highest level. However, they also dropped games to No. 5 Alabama, No. 6 Kentucky, No. 6 Tennessee, and No. 3 Florida, with the four-game losing skid from late February through early March \u2014 losses to Mississippi State, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, and Florida by a combined 53 points \u2014 exposing real vulnerabilities in offensive consistency, particularly from three-point range and at the free-throw line. Their final five games told the full story of this team's Jekyll-and-Hyde nature: a stunning upset of top-ranked Auburn (83-72), a wire-to-wire road win at LSU (66-52) to close the regular season on a high note, and then a gut-punch SEC Tournament exit at the hands of 13-seed Texas, who erased a 22-point second-half deficit in double overtime \u2014 a collapse that encapsulates this team's most troubling tendency.\n\nStylistically, Texas A&M wins through relentless rebounding \u2014 they lead the nation in offensive rebounds and routinely post 20-plus second-chance point advantages \u2014 suffocating defense that has held every opponent below their season scoring average, and clutch individual performances from their two-headed offensive engine. Wade Taylor IV, the program's all-time leading scorer who battled through a knee injury that cost him three SEC games in January, is the unquestioned heartbeat of this offense; when healthy and locked in, he is capable of 29-point tournament performances as he showed in the SEC Tournament loss to Texas, going 17-of-18 from the line. Zhuric Phelps, the SMU transfer, is arguably the team's most dynamic offensive option off the bench, having dropped a career-high 34 points in a road comeback win at Oklahoma and adding 19 points in the Auburn upset. Role players like Henry Coleman III, Pharrel Payne, Andersson Garcia, and Manny Obaseki provide genuine depth, with Coleman shooting 77.7% in the Players Era Festival and Obaseki delivering a tournament-winning corner 3 at Ole Miss. The concern, however, is that this team shoots a paltry three-point percentage \u2014 worst in the SEC \u2014 and has repeatedly gone cold at the worst moments, including missing their final 11 shots against Oregon in November and going 4-of-24 from three in a win over Oklahoma where they survived on rebounding alone. They play with genuine toughness and resilience \u2014 the Oklahoma comeback from 18 down without Taylor was one of the season's most impressive performances nationally \u2014 but the Texas collapse in the SEC Tournament, where they blew a 22-point lead in regulation and then missed seven of their last eight shots in the second overtime, is impossible to ignore. At home, they went 12-1 and are a different team entirely; on the road and at neutral sites, they are 7-8 and prone to offensive droughts that their defense cannot always compensate for. Texas A&M is a legitimate Elite Eight threat with the tools to make a Final Four run \u2014 their rebounding edge, defensive identity, and star power give them a viable path against almost anyone \u2014 but their three-point shooting fragility, late-game collapse history, and the psychological shadow of their SEC Tournament implosion make a national title run unrealistic. **Realistic ceiling: Elite Eight**, with a Sweet 16 exit being the most probable outcome if their offense goes cold at the wrong moment.",

      "2024-11-12 - Purdue: 92 vs Yale: 84\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- \u2014 Braden Smith finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and six assists Monday night and Trey Kaufman-Renn added 17 points to lead No. 13 Purdue past Yale 92-84. The Boilermakers (3-0) extended their home winning streak to 21, tying the third-longest in Mackey Arena history. They've also won 24 consecutive November games and still have not lost a regular-season non-conference game since December 2020. John Poulakidas scored 23 points and made five 3-pointers to lead Yale (1-2). Samson Aletan had a career high 14 points and seven rebounds for the defending Ivy League champs. Purdue played without 7-foot-4 freshman Daniel Jacobsen, who fractured his right tibia in his second career start Friday. He is scheduled to have surgery Wednesday and could miss the rest of this season. The Boilermakers student section also was on its best behavior Monday after university officials threatened to remove anyone who repeated Friday's chant about firing football coach Ryan Walters. Takeaways Yale: The Bulldogs managed to withstand Purdue's size and speed, but the perimeter struggles were costly. Eventually, Yale ran out of gas. But this is a team that could win another conference crown. Purdue: Coach Matt Painter's squad continues to dominate the season's first month, even against potential NCAA Tournament teams. The Boilermakers must play much cleaner basketball when they face tougher foes, a challenge that begins in this weekend. Key moment Camden Heide made two 3s, forced a turnover and saw his effort to snag an offensive rebound lead to a missed layup for Yale. Smith used that miss to set up a dunk by Myles Colvin that gave Purdue a 72-60 lead with 7:30 to go. Key stat Yale actually won the scoring battle in the paint 50-24 but went 8 for 26 on 3s while the Boilermakers were 11 for 23. Up next Yale hosts Emerson on Wednesday and Purdue hosts No. 2 Alabama on Friday night. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

Minnesota has won three of its first four games for the third straight year.

    "profile_summary": "Yale enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 13-seed with a 22-8 record, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built almost entirely on Ivy League dominance but tested \u2014 and found wanting \u2014 against high-major competition. The Bulldogs went 1-3 against Power conference opponents in the non-conference slate, losing to UIC (91-79), Purdue (92-84), Minnesota (59-56), and Rhode Island (84-78), while falling in a heartbreaker to UTEP (75-74) at a neutral site \u2014 a loss that exposes a team that can compete with better competition but has not yet demonstrated the ability to close out quality opponents. Against ranked competition, Yale's lone notable data point is a competitive showing at then-No. 13 Purdue, where they lost by eight despite winning the paint 50-24, a game that revealed both their interior toughness and their fatal perimeter limitations (8-of-26 from three against the Boilermakers). Their record against ranked or high-major opponents is effectively 0-5, a sobering reality for a team otherwise riding a wave of Ivy League momentum. Yale did own the nation's longest active winning streak at 13 games at one point, going a perfect 13-0 in Ivy play before dropping a late regular-season game at Harvard (74-69) \u2014 a loss that briefly raised questions before the Bulldogs rebounded to win the Ivy League Tournament, edging Princeton 59-57 on a Poulakidas three-pointer with 62 seconds left and defeating Cornell 90-84 in the championship. Their final five games \u2014 wins over Brown (70-61), Princeton (59-57), and Cornell (90-84), sandwiched around a loss at Harvard \u2014 reflect a team that is capable but vulnerable to pressure moments, winning two of those three games by margins of two and six points respectively, never quite pulling away comfortably. Yale is a high-scoring, multi-creator offense \u2014 John Poulakidas (the engine, capable of 23-32 point explosions), Nick Townsend (a reliable double-double threat inside), Bez Mbeng (a triple-double-capable playmaker), and Casey Simmons (a secondary scorer who has stepped up when needed) give them legitimate offensive depth \u2014 but their three-point shooting is wildly inconsistent, ranging from historic (Poulakidas going 6-of-7 from deep vs. Fairfield) to alarming (8-of-26 vs. Purdue, 1-of-4 vs. Dartmouth). The Bulldogs play with genuine energy and resilience \u2014 they have twice rallied or held on in nail-biters in the Ivy Tournament \u2014 but they have also shown a tendency to go cold from the perimeter at the worst moments, and their composure late in games against quality opponents (the Harvard and Minnesota losses, the UTEP near-miss) suggests a team that competes hard but lacks the elite execution needed to consistently finish. Yale plays better at home (where they rolled through the Ivy schedule) and has been inconsistent on the road and at neutral sites, going 0-3 in true road or neutral losses of consequence. **Verdict**: Yale is a dangerous but limited 13-seed \u2014 a team capable of making the first round uncomfortable for a 4-seed with their offensive firepower and battle-tested Ivy Tournament experience, but realistically a **first-round exit**. Their non-conference record against quality opposition (0-5) and chronic perimeter inconsistency make a second-round run highly unlikely against the caliber of opponent they will face in the bracket.",

    "profile_summary": "Missouri enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed with a 22-12 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine quality and marquee wins, though significant late-season turbulence clouds their outlook. Against ranked opponents, the Tigers went an impressive 7-7, with standout victories over No. 1 Kansas (76-67), No. 5 Florida on the road (83-82), No. 4 Alabama at home (110-98), and No. 14 Mississippi State on the road (88-61) \u2014 a collection of wins that would make any program proud. However, Missouri's final five games tell a sobering story: losses at Arkansas (92-85), at Oklahoma (96-84), and at home to Kentucky (91-83) \u2014 surrendering an average of 94.7 points per game over that three-game skid \u2014 were followed by an SEC Tournament win over Mississippi State (85-73) and a 95-81 quarterfinal loss to Florida in which leading scorer Mark Mitchell sat out with a knee injury. That injury to Mitchell is arguably the most critical variable entering the bracket; he is listed as available for tournament play but carries a health question mark after being held out in Nashville. Missouri plays a high-octane offensive style capable of erupting for 100-plus points \u2014 as demonstrated in the Alabama blowout \u2014 and relies heavily on 3-point shooting, going 12-0 this season when making at least eight threes, but that same perimeter dependence became a liability in losses to Texas (4-of-20 from deep) and Tennessee. The Tigers are powered by a veteran core: Tamar Bates (multiple 20-plus point performances), Caleb Grill (a graduate student who delivered 22 points at Florida and 28 in overtime at Vanderbilt), and Mitchell (career-high 31 against Alabama), while Anthony Robinson II and Tony Perkins provide reliable secondary production. Missouri was a dominant 18-1 at home, demonstrating elite comfort in Columbia, but struggled to replicate that energy on the road, losing six road games outright and showing a worrying tendency to surrender leads and allow opponents to shoot efficiently against them in hostile environments \u2014 the Oklahoma rematch, in which the Sooners shot 69% in the first half of a game Missouri won by 24 points just weeks earlier, is a cautionary tale. The Tigers are scrappy and resilient when engaged, evidenced by the comeback win over Cal (erasing a 16-point deficit) and the gutsy Florida road win on Grill's late free throws, but they are also collapse-prone and defensively porous in stretches, allowing three straight opponents to score 85-plus to close the regular season. On neutral sites, their limited sample \u2014 the SEC Tournament \u2014 showed they can compete (beating Mississippi State) but also exposed their vulnerability without Mitchell against a top-tier Florida team. Missouri's tournament ceiling is a Sweet 16 run if Mitchell is healthy and their three-point shooting is clicking: they have more than enough star power, big-game experience, and offensive firepower to knock off a higher seed or two, but their defensive inconsistency, late-season losing streak, and road struggles make a run deeper than the Elite Eight highly unlikely against the elite competition that awaits.",

    "profile_summary": "Drake enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 11-seed with a remarkable 31-4 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that demands respect despite the mid-major label. The Bulldogs won the Missouri Valley Conference outright for the first time since 2007-08 and set a program record for wins in a single season. Their most impressive non-conference scalps came at the Charleston Classic, where they defeated ACC opponent Miami 80-69 and beat Vanderbilt 81-70 to win the tournament title, plus a dramatic overtime win at Kansas State 73-70 in which Bennett Stirtz hit the game-winner with 3.4 seconds left \u2014 genuine quality wins that demonstrate this team can compete against high-major opposition. Their four losses came against UIC (on the road), Murray State, Bradley (twice, including a late-season home upset), suggesting occasional vulnerability against physical, well-coached mid-majors who can match their intensity, though Drake avenged all four of those losses. Entering the NCAA Tournament, Drake is playing as well as any team in the country at the mid-major level: their final five games produced wins over Northern Iowa (64-58 OT), Evansville (65-61), Missouri State (68-60 OT), and then back-to-back dominant MVC Tournament victories over Southern Illinois (70-53) and Belmont (57-50) before dismantling Bradley 63-48 in the championship \u2014 a statement win against the team that handed them two of their four losses. That conference tournament run showed a team that can win grinding defensive battles as comfortably as they can win shootouts, and the Bradley blowout in the final was a clear message of peak form at exactly the right time. Drake's identity is multidimensional but anchored by Bennett Stirtz, the MVC Player of the Year, who has been spectacular down the stretch \u2014 posting 26 points and 10 rebounds in the Northern Iowa overtime win, 24 points in the Belmont semifinal, and consistently delivering in clutch moments all season long. Stirtz is the engine: a relentless creator who scores, distributes, rebounds, and steals, capable of 30-point outbursts as easily as 14-point workhorse efforts. Around him, Mitch Mascari is a dangerous floor-spacing shooter who hit eight threes against Kansas State, Daniel Abreu has been a reliable secondary scorer and rebounder, and Tavion Banks provides a physical, high-efficiency punch off the bench. The team's composure in overtime situations \u2014 winning five extra-period games across the season \u2014 speaks to a mature, resilient group that does not panic when games get tight. Defensively, Drake entered the year ranked fourth nationally in scoring defense, and that identity has held: opponents routinely struggle to crack 60 against them, and the Bulldogs rarely get blown out. On neutral sites specifically, Drake is outstanding \u2014 the Charleston Classic title, the MVC Tournament title, and the Kansas City overtime win collectively show a team that thrives away from home on the biggest stages, which is the exact environment the NCAA Tournament provides. The realistic ceiling for this Drake team is the Sweet 16, with a legitimate path to the Elite Eight if the bracket sets up favorably: they are disciplined, deep, battle-tested, led by a legitimate star in Stirtz, and playing their best basketball right now \u2014 a dangerous 11-seed capable of pulling off multiple upsets, but likely lacking the raw athleticism to sustain a Final Four run against blue-blood programs.",

Zach Hicks sandwiched a pair of 3-pointers around a pair of free throws to help the Nittany Lions (13-11, 3-10) take 16-14 lead midway through the first half, but Tyler Bilodeau scored at the basket and Skyy Clark and Johnson each dunked following a Penn State turnover as the Bruins went on a 10-0 run to take a 25-16 lead that ballooned to a 44-31 advantage at intermission. Johnson hit 7 of 12 from the field, including 0-for-3 from distance, and added six assists, four steals and a blocked shot to his totals. Clark was 6 of 7 from the floor and added 14 points and Sebastian Mack added another 14 points off the UCLA bench. Bilodeau contributed 11 points. The Bruins shot 47% from the floor (31 of 66) and had 21 assists and 13 steals. Penn State, which lost its fifth straight game and ninth in its last 10, shot 38% for the game (19 of 50) and was 11 of 12 from the free throw line. Hicks was the lone double-digit scorer with 14 points and eight rebounds. The victory leaves UCLA coach Mick Cronin just two wins shy of his 500th career victory.

    "profile_summary": "UCLA enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 7-seed with a 23-11 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine Big Ten competitiveness but also troubling inconsistency at the worst possible times. Against ranked opponents, the Bruins went an impressive 7-5, with signature wins over then-No. 12 Oregon (on a Dylan Andrews buzzer-bank), then-No. 14 Gonzaga (a clutch late-game surge), then-No. 18 Wisconsin (twice), then-No. 16 Oregon (a dominant 26-point blowout), and then-No. 9 Michigan State (on an Eric Dailey Jr. go-ahead bucket with 7 seconds left) \u2014 but losses to Michigan (19 points), Maryland (18 points), and Nebraska at home highlight a team that can be exposed when road-weary or defensively vulnerable. Their final five games tell a complicated story: a 90-63 blowout of USC to close the regular season was followed by a 16-point demolition at the hands of Wisconsin in the Big Ten Tournament, leaving the Bruins going 3-2 over that stretch with a 4-4 record across their final eight games \u2014 hardly the momentum a bubble-adjacent team wants entering March. UCLA is a schizophrenic team stylistically: capable of wire-to-wire domination at home (finishing 15-2 at Pauley Pavilion) and genuinely clutch in close games (8-3 in games decided by five or fewer points), but alarmingly collapse-prone on the road and dangerously susceptible to hot three-point shooting, as Wisconsin exposed them twice \u2014 most recently shooting 19-of-whatever from deep for an 86-70 rout.\n\nThe Bruins' identity runs through Eric Dailey Jr., who has emerged as the team's most reliable playmaker down the stretch, posting a career-high 25 points against USC and consistently delivering in big moments, while Tyler Bilodeau remains the offensive fulcrum with a team-leading scoring average and key contributions in multiple ranked wins \u2014 though his ankle injury in late January is worth monitoring. Sebastian Mack off the bench provides elite scoring punch, Aday Mara has developed into a legitimate interior force (7-of-7 from the field in the Wisconsin regular-season win), and Skyy Clark provides clutch free-throw execution and three-point efficiency. The team's early-season defensive identity \u2014 ranking No. 1 nationally in scoring defense at one point, holding opponents to 55 points per game \u2014 has eroded as Big Ten play wore on, and their three-point defense in particular is a glaring vulnerability that any tournament opponent with perimeter shooters will target immediately. UCLA is undeniably a better team at home, and their neutral-site record (3-3) is mixed \u2014 they knocked off Gonzaga in Inglewood but lost to North Carolina at MSG and were dismantled in Indianapolis \u2014 raising real concerns about replicating their best basketball in a tournament setting. Mick Cronin's team has the veteran clutch gene and ranked-win credibility to be a dangerous 7-seed capable of knocking off a 2-seed in an upset, but the Big Ten Tournament exit, persistent road struggles (6-8 away from home), defensive breakdowns against elite perimeter teams, and late-season inconsistency all cap this team's realistic ceiling at the **Sweet 16** \u2014 a dangerous, experienced squad that can beat anyone on a given night, but lacks the sustained elite-level execution required for a Final Four run.",

    "profile_summary": "Utah State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 10-seed with a 26-8 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a genuinely good Mountain West program capable of beating quality opponents, but one that has shown real vulnerability down the stretch. The Aggies made national noise early, rattling off a 10-0 start that included a notable neutral-site win over Iowa in the Hall of Fame Classic, where Mason Falslev dropped 25 points and 12 rebounds to close out the Hawkeyes 77-69. Against ranked and quality competition, Utah State showed flashes of legitimacy \u2014 they knocked off Saint Mary's on the road in December and handled San Diego State twice \u2014 but repeated losses to New Mexico (63-82 at home, 79-82 on the road) and a late-season beatdown at Colorado State (66-93) revealed that this team can get physically overwhelmed by elite-level opponents. In the Mountain West Tournament, they dispatched UNLV comfortably in the quarterfinals before being blown out early by Colorado State in the semis, trailing 49-30 at halftime and never recovering. Recent form is the central concern heading into the bracket: over their final five games, Utah State went 2-3, with the two wins coming against Air Force (87-47) and UNLV (70-58), while the losses came against San Diego State's road version, Boise State (65-82), Colorado State twice, and the MW semis \u2014 a skid that shows a team fading at precisely the wrong moment.\n\nStylistically, Utah State is at their best in high-scoring, multi-threat offensive environments where Ian Martinez can take over clutch situations \u2014 his 17 consecutive points to close out Nevada and his 4-point play with seven seconds left to beat Boise State 81-79 are emblematic of a team capable of dramatic, willed victories. Martinez is clearly the engine, capable of 30-point performances (Fresno State), but also capable of going cold (2-for-10 against St. Bonaventure) at critical moments. Falslev is a legitimate two-way weapon \u2014 his 27-point, 6-rebound, 5-steal effort in the MW semifinal loss showed he can perform on big stages even in defeat \u2014 and role players like Dexter Akanno and Karson Templin provide enough depth to keep opponents honest. The Aggies are resilient and capable of clutch comebacks, but they are also prone to getting physically dominated inside and defensively exposed when opponents attack the paint, as UNLV demonstrated by outscoring them 36-20 in the paint in their first meeting. Utah State plays noticeably better at home (strong against Montana, Wyoming, Boise State, Colorado State in the first meeting) and has shown enough on neutral sites to not be dismissed, but their road record features some ugly performances. As a 10-seed, they are dangerous enough to steal a first-round game \u2014 Martinez's shot-making ability alone makes them a threat in a single-elimination setting \u2014 but the late-season defensive lapses, susceptibility to dominant big men, and repeated struggles against top-half Mountain West competition suggest a Sweet 16 run is a ceiling, not an expectation. **Realistic tournament ceiling: Round of 32, with a puncher's chance at the Sweet 16 if Martinez gets hot at the right moment.**",

RJ Luis Jr. had 13 points, Aaron Scott scored 11 and the 6-foot Smith grabbed a team-high eight rebounds as St. John's (3-0) pulled away down the stretch following a choppy performance over the first 30 minutes.

The Red Storm (22-4, 13-2) lead the Bluejays (18-8, 11-4) by two games.

They\u2019ll play No. 25 Marquette in the first semifinal Friday night at Madison Square Garden, after the fifth-seeded Golden Eagles rallied for an 89-87 win over No. 4 seed Xavier. After going 23 years without reaching the Big East semis, the Red Storm have made it twice in two seasons under 72-year-old Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino. The resurgent Johnnies are seeking their fourth Big East Tournament title and first since 2000. Patrick McCaffery had 16 points to pace No. 9 seed Butler (14-19), a 75-69 winner over eighth-seeded Providence in the first round Wednesday. Finley Bizjack scored 10 before leaving early in the second half with an apparent ankle injury. WNBA star Caitlin Clark, wearing a Butler baseball cap, sat just behind the scorers\u2019 table near the team\u2019s bench. Clark\u2019s boyfriend is Bulldogs assistant coach Connor McCaffery, brother of Patrick. Patrick McCaffery overcame thyroid cancer as a teenager and later took a leave of absence to address anxiety while playing for his father, Fran, at Iowa. After exiting his final college game, the redshirt senior forward cried on his brother's shoulder along the sideline. Takeaways Butler: Since joining the Big East for the 2013-14 season, the only time the Bulldogs reached the conference semifinals was 2018.

They advanced to play No. 2 seed Creighton, a 71-62 semifinal winner over third-seeded UConn, on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden.

In the program's second season under 72-year-old Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino, the Johnnies are one win from their fourth Big East Tournament title and first since 2000. Kam Jones had 24 points for the fifth-seeded Golden Eagles (23-10), who lost all three matchups with the Red Storm this season and fell to 1-6 against them at the Big East Tournament. Takeaways Marquette: A lack of strength down low was a problem against Ejiofor and St. John\u2019s all season, but the Golden Eagles will be happy to face someone outside the Big East when they enter the NCAA Tournament. St. John\u2019s: Making a strong bid for a No. 2 seed in the NCAAs, the Red Storm improved to 20-0 at home, including 11-0 at MSG \u2014 the program\u2019s most wins at The Garden since compiling 13 in 1958-59. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season.

      "2025-03-15 - St. John's: 82 vs Creighton: 66\n\nNEW YORK -- \u2014 Regular-season champs. A tournament title. Pride in the program fully restored. The pied piper of college basketball rebuilds, Rick Pitino has St. John's back atop the Big East. And this time, the nets were coming down. RJ Luis Jr. scored all but two of his 29 points after halftime and No. 6 St. John's made 14 straight shots from the field in the second half to beat Creighton 82-66 on Saturday night for its first Big East Tournament title in 25 years. \u201cWow, this is incredible just to come from last year to this year and to see the transformation,\u201d Luis said. \u201cCoach P is the mastermind behind all of this. I mean, it\u2019s truly special.\u201d Zuby Ejiofor added 20 points and Kadary Richmond had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the top-seeded Red Storm (30-4), who reached 30 wins for the third time in program history before a roaring hometown crowd at sold-out Madison Square Garden. They earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for their first trip since 2019, making the 72-year-old Pitino the first coach to take six schools to the Big Dance. The others were Boston University, Providence, Kentucky, Louisville and Iona. \u201cGreat win for the city. Great win for our university. You hear it all along that it\u2019s New York\u2019s team, and it truly is,\u201d the Hall of Fame coach said. \u201cAs a New Yorker myself, I\u2019m very, very proud that St. John\u2019s has gotten to this level.\u201d Pitino, in his second season with the Johnnies, also became the first coach to win the Big East Tournament at two schools. He\u2019s won three times in his last four seasons in the league, after guiding Louisville to championships in 2009, 2012 and 2013. \u201cI saved the best for last,\u201d Pitino announced to loud cheers from the crowd of 19,812, pausing to remove falling confetti from his lips during a postgame interview on the court. Luis, the Big East Player of the Year, also grabbed 10 rebounds and was selected the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He was draped in a Dominican Republic flag as fans chanted \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d after the game. \u201cJust still trying to soak it in, and it\u2019s just crazy how much you can speak things into existence and just watch it all come together,\u201d Luis said. \u201cThis has by far been the most emotional, happiest week of my 22 years of existence.\u201d Ejiofor and Richmond made the All-Tournament team. \u201cThe three of them have been unstoppable,\u201d Pitino said. Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 15 points for second-seeded Creighton (24-10), which fell to 0-5 in Big East championship games since joining the conference for the 2013-14 season. \u201cIt's hard to get to this game, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d coach Greg McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to be here quite a few times. Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t been able to finish the job.\u201d When the resurgent Johnnies clinched their first outright regular-season conference championship in 40 years with a victory over Seton Hall at The Garden on March 1, they had already decided not to cut down the nets to celebrate. More work to do. But on this night, players and staff climbed the ladder and snipped their souvenirs. It was the fourth Big East Tournament title for the Johnnies, who made the championship game for the first time since winning the 2000 trophy under Mike Jarvis. The previous two came in the 1980s under Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca, who died Nov. 30 about five weeks shy of his 100th birthday. \u201cTo finally get over the hump, it\u2019s really an unbelievable feeling,\u201d Ejiofor said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be a part of history.\u201d And after the Red Storm cut down the nets, a message appeared on the giant video screen above center court: \u201cFor Looie.\" \u201cI\u2019m thinking he would be so proud of this team,\u201d said Pitino, who has quickly revived St. John's into a national power again late in his illustrious but checkered career. \u201cHumility is a big part of my life right now. It wasn\u2019t always that way,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in redemption. I believe in humility.\u201d The drought between Big East Tournament titles for the Johnnies was the longest for any team in league history. \u201cSt. John\u2019s didn\u2019t get built by the NIL. St. John\u2019s got built with character of the players,\" Pitino said. Luis was whistled for his second foul with 7:19 left before halftime and sat out the rest of the half. After falling behind by eight early, St. John\u2019s finally took its first lead at 43-41 with 11:55 remaining when backup big man Vince Iwuchukwu scored left-handed in the post over the 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner, the four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. That came 33 seconds after Ejiofor converted a tying three-point play that began a streak of 14 consecutive made field goals in 7:12 for the Red Storm, giving them a 70-55 lead. They connected on 17 of their final 19 field goal attempts to finish at 72% in the second period (23 for 32). Quite an offensive display for a team that entered the game shooting 45% from floor. \u201cWe definitely fed off the crowd, the energy, the atmosphere,\" Luis said. \u201cIt was ridiculous. It was very loud.\u201d By the numbers St. John\u2019s has won nine straight games, and 19 of 20 since the new year. The team finished 21-0 on its home courts, including 12-0 at MSG \u2014 the program\u2019s most wins at The Garden since compiling 13 in 1958-59. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season. Creighton injury Bluejays reserve Fedor Zugic injured his right ankle with 11:23 left in the first half and had to be helped off the court to the locker room. He didn\u2019t return. Key stat Creighton, which entered shooting 74% on free throws, missed six of its first eight from the line and finished 8 for 16. Up next Creighton: Headed to its fifth straight NCAA Tournament when the brackets are revealed Sunday. St. John\u2019s: Hasn\u2019t won an NCAA Tournament game in 25 years. Pitino and the streaking Red Storm seem likely to receive a No. 2 seed Sunday. \u201cWe still have a lot to prove. We\u2019re not done,\u201d Ejiofor said. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and"

    "profile_summary": "St. John's enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 2-seed with a 31-5 record and one of the most compelling resurgence stories in recent college basketball history \u2014 Big East regular-season champions, Big East Tournament champions, and winners of nine straight entering March Madness. Against ranked opponents, the Red Storm went an impressive 7-5, with marquee wins over No. 11 Marquette (twice), No. 19 UConn (twice), and No. 24 Creighton, while their losses came in genuinely competitive situations: a heartbreaking 99-98 double-overtime defeat to No. 13 Baylor on a buzzer-beater, a one-point loss at No. 24 Creighton on New Year's Eve, and a 73-71 defeat at Villanova when Tyler Perkins hit a go-ahead three with eight seconds left. Their final five games tell a story of a team absolutely peaking at the right moment: a buzzer-beating overtime win at Marquette (86-84) on Zuby Ejiofor's game-winner, followed by a Big East Tournament run in which they blew out Butler 78-57, erased a 15-point deficit to beat Marquette again 79-63, and then shot 72% in the second half to dismantle Creighton 82-66 in the championship game \u2014 RJ Luis Jr. dropping 29 points and winning tournament MVP. This team plays with layered, adaptable offensive firepower \u2014 capable of grinding out defensive victories, engineering dramatic comebacks (a 19-2 second-half run to beat Georgetown, a 16-point deficit erased against Xavier in overtime), and going on prolonged scoring runs (14 consecutive made field goals in the Big East title game) \u2014 and they are equally dangerous in close games and blowouts.\n\nThe engine of this team is a three-headed star group that would be the envy of any program in the country. Luis, the Big East Player of the Year, is logging double-doubles at a remarkable clip and delivering in the biggest moments \u2014 his 29-point, 10-rebound performance in the conference title game and 28-point, 11-rebound effort in overtime at Marquette demonstrate a player who elevates as the stakes rise. Ejiofor is perhaps the most dangerous complementary star in the country right now, setting a Big East Tournament record with 33 points against Marquette and delivering the buzzer-beater to win in Milwaukee; his physicality inside gives St. John's a matchup problem against virtually any opponent. Kadary Richmond posted the program's first triple-double this century (10 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) in that Marquette overtime win and is a force as a playmaker and rebounder at the guard position. The only meaningful health concern is point guard Deivon Smith, who has battled a shoulder injury and missed several games down the stretch, though he has returned and provides important ball-handling depth. Locationally, St. John's finished a perfect 21-0 at home \u2014 including 12-0 at Madison Square Garden \u2014 but also demonstrated genuine road and neutral-site toughness, winning at Georgetown, UConn, DePaul, and Butler, and going 3-1 on neutral courts including three straight Big East Tournament wins at MSG. This is a confident, battle-tested, deeply talented team with elite coaching, a proven ability to rally from double-digit deficits, and a roster built for March. Their realistic ceiling is the Final Four, with a credible case for the national championship game \u2014 the only question is whether Smith's health and a tendency to occasionally sleepwalk early (they trailed by 15 in both their Big East Tournament semifinal and final) could be exploited by a sufficiently physical elite opponent before they find their rhythm.",

    "profile_summary": "Omaha enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 15-seed with a 22-13 record, but that record requires significant context. The Mavericks went a brutal 2-9 against non-conference competition before finding their footing, dropping games to Minnesota (68-64), UNLV (80-69), Northern Iowa (78-58), and No. 3 Iowa State (83-51) \u2014 a blowout in which Marquel Sutton, their leading scorer, was held to just three points. Against ranked opponents, Omaha went 0-1 in games with meaningful detail, and their overall non-conference body of work includes losses to mid-major programs like Southern Utah, Alabama State, and Akron, raising real questions about their ceiling beyond the Summit League. That said, once conference play began, the Mavericks were dominant: they claimed the outright Summit League regular-season title at 13-3, rode a nine-game winning streak at one point, and closed the year by blowing out South Dakota 100-75 in the conference tournament semifinal behind Tony Osburn's stunning 9-for-11 performance from three (30 points). Their final five games produced wins by margins of 23, 12, 8, 25, and 43 points \u2014 an exceptionally hot stretch \u2014 and they enter the tournament with genuine momentum.\n\nOmaha's identity is built around a two-headed scoring attack in Sutton and JJ White, with Osburn providing elite three-point shooting as a third option. Sutton is a force \u2014 capable of 36-point, 12-rebound performances like his February outing against South Dakota \u2014 while White has been sensational in key moments, including a buzzer-beating three against North Dakota and a career-high 35 points at Oral Roberts. Osburn's 8-for-9 three-point explosion in the conference semifinal may be the most impressive single-game shooting performance of any team in the Summit League this year. The Mavericks are capable of winning wire-to-wire \u2014 they led 55-26 at halftime in that semifinal \u2014 but have also shown they can win in clutch moments and grind out close games. Their 9-3 stretch in Summit League road and neutral-site games suggests they aren't purely a home team, and their conference tournament play on a neutral floor in Sioux Falls has been commanding. However, the sample of meaningful competition remains thin: Omaha's best wins came against a Summit League field that produced no Top-25 teams, and their one true measuring-stick game against Iowa State was a 32-point dismantling. As a 15-seed, their realistic tournament ceiling is a first-round upset if the matchup presents a vulnerable 2-seed susceptible to three-point shooting and star-driven offense \u2014 Osburn and Sutton are legitimate enough to keep any game competitive in the first ten minutes \u2014 but a second-round run is a significant stretch given their inability to compete with high-major competition all season. **Verdict: likely first-round exit, with the tools to make any 2-seed uncomfortable for a half.**",

      "2025-03-15 - Michigan: 86 vs Purdue: 68\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Danny Wolf had 18 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, and No. 22 Michigan snapped a three-game losing streak with a 86-68 win over No. 20 Purdue Friday in a Big Ten Tournament quarterfinal. The second-seeded Wolverines (23-9) allowed the game's initial six points, then led for the final 37 minutes in an impressive bounce-back win to advance to a semifinal against No. 11 Maryland (25-7) on Saturday. Eight Michigan players scored at least six points. Vladislav Goldin added 15 points and eight rebounds. Tre Donaldson had 13 points and Roddy Gayle Jr. scored 11. Trey Kaufman-Renn led sixth-seeded Purdue (22-11) with 24 points and nine rebounds. Big Ten player of the year Braden Smith, who averaged 24 points and 8.5 assists in two regular-season meetings vs. Michigan, finished with 12 points on 5-of-18 shooting, 2 of 10 from 3-point range. He had six assists. Takeaways Purdue: The Boilermakers have a strong 1-2 offensive punch in Kaufman-Renn and Smith, but NCAA Tournament survival likely hinges on the supporting cast, which is capable but often inconsistent. Michigan: A much-needed confidence boost for the Wolverines after a lackluster regular-season finish. When this team shares the ball (25 assists) and limits turnovers (six), it's a tough out. Key moment Michigan opened the second half with a 12-5 spurt to build a 52-41 lead after a Donaldson 3-pointer. Key stat Despite Smith being the league leader in assists, Michigan had a 25-11 edge in the category. Up next Purdue awaits an NCAA Tournament bid.

      "2025-03-15 - Maryland: 80 vs Michigan: 81\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Tre Donaldson drove the length of the court and scored on a layup with 0.4 seconds left to give No. 22 Michigan an 81-80 victory over No. 11 Maryland in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals Saturday. Donaldson finished with 12 points and nine assists, but the heavy lifting was done by Vladislav Goldin, who had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Danny Wolf Jr. with 21 points and 14 rebounds. The Wolverines (24-9) will face No. 18 Wisconsin in Sunday's championship game in Indianapolis. Donaldson's remarkable drive rekindled images of Tyus Edney in 1995 and Danny Ainge in 1981, who made similar plays to add their stories to the March Madness book. This time, Maryland tried to preserve the lead without fouling. Derik Queen finished with a career high 31 points to lead the Terrapins (25-8) who entered the game on a nine-game winning streak. Selton Miguel added 16 points. Maryland has never reached the tourney's title game. Takeaways Michigan: The tandem of Wolf and Goldin \u2014 and the heroic play by Donaldson \u2014 were good enough to carry the Wolverines in the semifinals. But if they have another game with 19 turnovers, their dreams could end. Maryland: The Terrapins have relied heavily, perhaps too heavily, on points from their starters. But the bigger problem was not to front Donaldson on the drive, forcing him to burn precious time. Key moment Donaldson's full sprint from near his own baseline straight to the rim. Key stat Michigan's 47-18 rebounding edge was so dominant Wolf nearly outrebounded Maryland by himself. Up next The Wolverines are chasing their first tourney title since winning it back-to-back in 2017 and 2018. Maryland heads home to await the selection committee's bracket reveal. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

    "profile_summary": "Michigan enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 5-seed with a 27-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine Big Ten competitiveness, elite frontcourt production, and a knack for winning games they have no business winning late. Against ranked opponents, the Wolverines went an impressive 9-8, with signature wins over then-No. 11 Wisconsin on the road, No. 22 Xavier at a neutral site, No. 15 UCLA in Westwood (Michigan's first win at Pauley Pavilion since 2002), No. 7 Purdue at home (75-73), No. 8 Michigan State (86-83 on the road), and back-to-back ranked wins in the Big Ten Tournament over No. 20 Purdue and No. 11 Maryland \u2014 the latter on Tre Donaldson's full-court layup with 0.4 seconds remaining. Their losses to ranked competition \u2014 including a blowout at Purdue (91-64), a 13-point regular-season home loss to Michigan State (75-62), and a 20-point drubbing at the hands of Illinois \u2014 reveal a team that can be physically overwhelmed and exploited through turnovers when not at its best. Heading into the tournament, Michigan's last five games tell a volatile but ultimately encouraging story: a three-game losing skid (losses to Michigan State by 13, Maryland by 6, and Michigan State again by 17) was snapped emphatically in the Big Ten Tournament with wins over Purdue (86-68), Maryland (81-80), and Wisconsin (59-53) \u2014 three games in three days that represent the best sustained stretch of clutch basketball this team has played all season. That tournament run demonstrated everything Michigan is capable of: dominant interior play from 7-foot-1 Vladislav Goldin and 7-foot Danny Wolf, opportunistic guard play from Donaldson, and an ability to win both grind-it-out defensive battles and high-wire finishes.\n\nMichigan's identity is built around one of the most physically imposing frontcourts in the country. Goldin (career-high 36 against UCLA, 25 in the Big Ten semis) and Wolf (11 double-doubles, averaging elite two-way production including six blocks against USC) form a twin-tower combination that creates matchup nightmares \u2014 38 points in the paint against Xavier, a 47-18 rebounding edge over Maryland in the Big Ten semis, and 11 blocks against Wisconsin in December are not flukes but rather consistent outputs from two players who alter games at both ends. Donaldson is the engine of the offense, capable of scoring 20 and distributing equally, and his full-court layup to beat Maryland may be the most important play of his season. Nimari Burnett provides shooting punch off the bench (5-of-7 from three against Western Kentucky; buzzer-beater against Rutgers), and Roddy Gayle Jr. has stepped up repeatedly in pressure moments. The concern, however, is real: Michigan has committed 22 turnovers in a game, shot 30% from the floor at Nebraska, and gone 4-of-28 from three against Oklahoma \u2014 volatility that a sharp tournament opponent will try to exploit. The Wolverines are 13-1 at home this season but have been tested on the road and neutral sites, going 6-4 in such settings against quality competition, which suggests the neutral-site tournament environment neither dramatically helps nor hurts them. Their tournament ceiling is the Elite Eight: this team has the star power, size, toughness, and big-game pedigree to advance past the first weekend, but their turnover issues, three-point inconsistency, and demonstrated vulnerability against elite pressure defense make a Final Four run a stretch. A motivated, well-coached opponent that can generate turnovers and contest the paint will expose Michigan's limitations \u2014 but in a bracket where any two or three games might not feature that kind of opponent, the Wolverines are absolutely capable of making noise into the second weekend.",

    "profile_summary": "UC San Diego enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 12-seed with a 30-5 record and the Big West Conference regular season and tournament titles in hand \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that is genuinely impressive for a program in its first year of postseason eligibility after transitioning to Division I. The Tritons' most notable quality win came in December, when they knocked off Utah State on the road 75-73 \u2014 at the time a team riding a 10-game winning streak \u2014 with Tyler McGhie delivering 15 clutch second-half points to seal a two-point road victory that stands as UCSD's clearest statement against legitimate high-major-adjacent competition. Beyond that, their schedule was heavily Big West-centric, and while they dominated that conference (18-2), evidence against truly elite opponents is thin: their only ranked-caliber road test was a narrow loss to San Diego State to open the season and a one-point escape at Utah State. Against the rest of their schedule, however, they have been ruthlessly efficient \u2014 blowing out Cal State Fullerton 100-55, rolling past Hawaii 83-44, and cruising past La Verne 109-33, suggesting a team that feasts on inferior competition but hasn't faced the kind of athleticism and depth typical of a 5-seed in March.\n\nEntering the tournament, UCSD is playing as well as any team in the country within its own sphere: the Tritons have won 14 consecutive games, capped by a dominant Big West Tournament run that included a 69-51 semifinal dismantling of UC Santa Barbara \u2014 after trailing at halftime \u2014 and a 75-61 championship win over UC Irvine. Their style of play is built around an elite offensive engine fueled by two legitimate scorers in Aniwaniwa Tait-Jones and Tyler McGhie, who have been devastating in tandem all season. Tait-Jones is their engine \u2014 posting multiple 20-plus and even 32-point performances down the stretch, adding rebounds, assists, and defensive activity \u2014 while McGhie is a lethal perimeter threat who shot 7-for-10 from three against San Diego in December and consistently carries the offense in clutch moments. Hayden Gray serves as a steady tertiary option, and Nordin Kapic provides a reliable interior presence. The team has demonstrated genuine resilience \u2014 coming back from a halftime deficit to beat both Hawaii and UC Santa Barbara in the conference tournament \u2014 and rarely looks rattled. Their two conference losses to UC Irvine and UC Riverside were revealing, however: the Riverside loss came in a game where Barrington Hargress went off for 40 points, exposing some vulnerability against elite individual scorers, and the Irvine loss showed they can be contained on the road. UCSD is 7-3 in true road and neutral-site games, with quality neutral wins over Toledo, James Madison, and La Salle at the Boardwalk Battle early in the season, suggesting they are comfortable outside their own building. This is a confident, well-coached team on a historic run for their program \u2014 but their lack of consistent exposure to high-major competition and susceptibility to hot individual scorers makes a deep run a tall order. **Realistic ceiling: Round of 32.** UCSD is dangerous enough to knock off a 5-seed \u2014 particularly given their offensive firepower and current momentum \u2014 but the talent and experience gap against a Power Conference program in the Round of 32 is likely too steep for a program still cutting its teeth on the national stage.",

      "2025-03-09 - Arizona State: 57 vs Texas Tech: 85\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. -- \u2014 JT Toppin had 25 points and 11 rebounds, and No. 9 Texas Tech pulled away from Arizona State for an 85-57 victory in the regular-season finale for both teams Saturday. Freshman guard Christian Anderson tied a season high with 21 points and made four 3-pointers off the bench for the Red Raiders (24-7, 15-5 Big 12), who set a school record for conference wins. Toppin, a top contender for Big 12 Player of the Year, had his 14th double-double of the season. Kerwin Walton added 11 points and three 3-pointers for the Red Raiders. Texas Tech had clinched the No. 2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament when Kansas beat Arizona earlier Saturday. Basheer Jihad equaled a career high with 22 points and Joson Sanon had 16 for the Sun Devils (13-18, 4-16), who have lost 10 of 11. Anderson\u2019s 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer gave the Red Raiders a 36-32 lead, and they outscored Arizona State 49-25 in the second half. Toppin had 41 points in the first meeting Feb. 12, when the Red Raiders set a program record for points in a conference game in a 111-106 overtime victory in Lubbock. Takeaways Texas Tech: Set a school record with its 15th conference victory in the expanded Big 12. The Red Raiders were 14-4 in league play in 2019. Arizona State: Played without leading scorer BJ Freeman and Adam Miller, who combined for 43 points in the overtime loss at Lubbock. Key moment Toppin had a rebound, a three-point play, an assist, a blocked shot and a tip-in in a 96-second span midway through the second half for a 10-point lead, kick-starting the Red Raiders\u2019 second-half run. Key stat Texas Tech made 12 3-pointers and has hit at least 10 in 19 games this season, another record. The team averages 10.1 per game, second in the Big 12.

      "2025-03-13 - Texas Tech: 76 vs Baylor: 74\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 JT Toppin had 26 points and 10 rebounds to lift No. 9 Texas Tech to a 76-74 victory over Baylor in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals on Thursday night. The second-seeded Red Raiders never trailed but almost gave up the lead in the final minute after missing their final 10 field-goal attempts. VJ Edgecombe's attempt at a tying jumper at the buzzer missed off the glass. Darrion Williams scored 14 points and Elijah Hawkins and Kerwin Walton had 12 each for Texas Tech (25-7), which will face Arizona in Friday's semifinals. Norchad Omier had 29 points and 15 rebounds for seventh-seeded Baylor (19-14). Takeaways Baylor: The Bears need more offense from players other than Omier. Edgecombe, with 11 points, was the only other Baylor player in double figures. Texas Tech: The Red Raiders shot 19.4% from the field in the second half, including 3 of 15 from 3-point range. Key moment Omier picked up two fouls in 11 seconds, the second with 9:46 left, giving him four for the game. He went to the bench with the Bears trailing 68-58. The Bears managed to cut into the lead, but their momentum was stalled when Jeremy Roach picked up his fourth foul with 5:29 left.

      "2025-03-15 - Texas Tech: 80 vs Arizona: 86\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 Caleb Love scored 27 points and Arizona took advantage of injuries that left Texas Tech short-handed for an 86-80 victory over the No. 9 Red Raiders in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals Friday night. KJ Lewis added 15 points and Henri Veesaar scored eight of his 10 in the closing minutes for the Wildcats (22-11), who advanced to the championship game against No. 2 Houston on Saturday night in their first season in their new league. Kevin Overton had 20 points and Christian Anderson scored 19 for the Red Raiders (25-8), who played without Chance McMillian and Darrion Williams because of injuries, and then watched star forward JT Toppin throw up in the arena tunnel. Toppin made it through the game, but the All-Big 12 forward managed just 11 points in 25 minutes. Compounding problems short-handed Texas Tech, point guard Elijah Hawkins picked up his fourth foul with 14:56 to go, leaving coach Grant McCasland with precious few options on his bench in the second half. The Red Raiders trailed by as much as 14 before nevertheless mounting a comeback, closing to 78-74 on two free throws by Anderson with 2:40 to go. Veesaar answered with back-to-back baskets and Arizona held on from there. Takeaways Arizona: The Wildcats were 8 of 16 from beyond the 3-point arc and shot 51% from the field overall. Texas Tech: The Red Raiders couldn't overcome the fact that their three leading scorers were ill or absent. McMillian missed the second half of its quarterfinal win with what the school called an \u201cupper body strain,\u201d while Williams was wearing a walking boot on his right foot after he appeared to aggravate an injury that has bothered him the last few weeks against the Bears. Key moment Veesaar was quiet until the closing minutes, when the 7-footer made a series of big baskets. Key stat The Red Raiders were missing a combined 28.5 points per game with McMillian and Williams unavailable. Up next Arizona will play Houston for the Big 12 Tournament title. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and"

    "profile_summary": "Texas Tech enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 3-seed with a 28-9 record, having earned the program's first-ever 15-win Big 12 season and a double-bye into the conference tournament quarterfinals \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine, sustained excellence in one of college basketball's toughest leagues. Against ranked opponents, the Red Raiders went an impressive 8-6, with signature wins over #6 Houston (82-81 OT on the road), #3 Iowa State, #20 Arizona (at home), and Kansas in Allen Fieldhouse \u2014 a venue where Texas Tech was previously 1-21 all-time. Those victories demonstrate the Red Raiders are capable of beating anyone on any given night. However, their losses against ranked teams \u2014 including home defeats to UCF (unranked at the time but a Quality 1 result), Texas A&M, and a road loss to Arizona \u2014 reveal a team that can be had when it is not shooting well or playing shorthanded. Over their final five games, Texas Tech went 3-2: a dominant 91-75 win over Colorado, an 85-57 blowout of Arizona State, a tight 76-74 Big 12 quarterfinal win over Baylor in which they shot 19.4% in the second half, and then an 86-80 loss to Arizona in the Big 12 semifinals \u2014 a game played without Chance McMillian and Darrion Williams due to injury, and with star forward JT Toppin visibly ill and limited to 11 points. That injury cloud is the defining storyline entering March.\n\nTexas Tech's identity is built around three-point volume, frontcourt dominance, and clutch resilience. The Red Raiders average 10.1 threes per game and hit double digits in 19 games this season, a program record, led by McMillian \u2014 the Big 12's top 3-point shooter at 45.4% \u2014 when he is healthy. Toppin is the engine of everything, a 6-foot-9 transfer from New Mexico who recorded 14 double-doubles this season, dropped a career-high 41 points against Arizona State, and carried the team to multiple wins through sheer force; when he is locked in, this team has an elite ceiling. Freshman Christian Anderson has emerged as a genuine third scoring option, scoring 21 in two separate games down the stretch. The team is at its best when it plays with composure and handles adversity \u2014 it refused to lose consecutive games all season, bounced back from an early ejection of coach Grant McCasland in Houston and still won in overtime, and rallied from double-digit deficits multiple times. At home, Texas Tech was a dominant 15-3; on the road and neutral sites they were a respectable 13-6, with the wins at Allen Fieldhouse and Houston standing as two of the most impressive results in the Big 12 this year. The concern entering the tournament is health: if McMillian and Williams are not available or are compromised, the Red Raiders are asking Toppin to carry an enormous load against elite defenses with a short bench \u2014 a vulnerability Arizona exposed mercilessly in Kansas City. A healthy Texas Tech is a legitimate Elite Eight threat with Final Four upside; a shorthanded one is a dangerous but beatable 3-seed. **Realistic ceiling: Elite Eight**, with a first-or-second-round exit possible if the injury situation does not stabilize.",

    "profile_summary": "UNC Wilmington enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 14-seed with a 27-8 record, a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9 within the Colonial Athletic Association that is tempered by limited success against elite competition. The Seahawks' most notable non-conference measuring stick came in a 84-66 road loss at No. 1 Kansas in November \u2014 a game where they kept it close through halftime before a 12-2 Jayhawks run broke things open in the second half. Beyond that marquee matchup, UNCW dropped road games to Colgate (72-59) and Howard (88-83), the latter coming after blowing a second-half lead, and fell to Towson in overtime in their CAA opener. Against lower-tier competition, however, the Seahawks have been dominant, routinely building double-digit halftime leads and winning wire-to-wire. Their conference tournament run further illustrates their ceiling: they handled Hampton comfortably in the quarterfinals (79-65), then survived Charleston 68-67 in the semifinals on a pair of Bo Montgomery free throws with three seconds left \u2014 a gut-check moment that speaks to their competitive character.\n\nEntering the tournament, UNCW's final five games (Hampton road loss, William & Mary win, Campbell win, a missing game summary, and the two CAA tournament wins) show a team that stumbled on the road down the stretch \u2014 losing at Hampton 83-70 and getting blown out by Elon 81-70 at home \u2014 before steadying itself in Washington. The Seahawks are a balanced, multi-contributor offense led by Donovan Newby, who can erupt for 30-plus points on any given night (30 vs. Hofstra, 24 vs. Charleston in the semis) and is at his best at the free-throw line. Khamari McGriff is a reliable and efficient interior scorer off the bench, Harlan Obioha provides a physical frontcourt presence with shot-blocking ability, and Bo Montgomery contributes consistent two-way energy. Sean Moore's 23-point, 15-rebound double-double in a double-overtime win at Drexel stands out as a signature performance. The Seahawks tend to play with composure in close games \u2014 the Charleston semifinal comeback and the Drexel thriller both demonstrate resilience \u2014 but they are demonstrably vulnerable to hot three-point shooting, as Elon's TK Simpkins (32 points, 8-of-10 from three) single-handedly dismantled them in February. They are also a clear home team, going wire-to-wire against nearly everyone at Trask Coliseum while showing a tendency to be sluggish in road environments. As a 14-seed, they face steep odds, but they are not a pushover: they play with grit, have a genuine go-to scorer in Newby, and have demonstrated the ability to win close games. Their realistic tournament ceiling is a first-round upset \u2014 they have the offensive firepower and late-game poise to steal a game from a 3-seed on a neutral floor \u2014 but advancing to the Sweet 16 would require overcoming significant talent deficits that their non-conference schedule exposed all season.",

Mississippi State led 37-34 at halftime, despite 15 points from Fears. Moore made a 3-pointer, then dunked on a fast break to put the Sooners up 44-41 early in the second half. He hit another 3-pointer to push the margin to 53-48. Oklahoma\u2019s Brycen Goodine hit a 3-pointer from the corner and was fouled with 4:50 remaining. He made the free throw to put the Sooners up 81-69. Mississippi State kept scrapping. Claudell Harris Jr. made a contested corner 3 to cut Oklahoma's lead to 90-87 with 28 seconds remaining. Takeaways Mississippi State: The Bulldogs had 20 offensive rebounds and 21 second-chance points yet shot just 39.7% from the field. Oklahoma: The Sooners, who have struggled with mistakes this season, committed just 11 turnovers. Key moment Moore collected a defensive rebound in traffic and was fouled with 11.3 seconds remaining.

      "2025-02-26 - Alabama: 111 vs Mississippi State: 73\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- \u2014 Chris Youngblood scored a season-best 27 points and No. 6 Alabama made nearly half of its 45 attempts from 3-point range in a 111-73 win over No. 24 Mississippi State on Tuesday night. Mark Sears had 21 points and 10 assists for the Crimson Tide (23-5, 12-3 Southeastern Conference), who set a season high for 3s by going 22 of 45 from long range (49%). Youngblood was 7 for 11 beyond the arc, and Sears finished 5 for 12. Jarin Stevenson went 3 for 3 off the bench. Reserve guard Aden Holloway also drained a trio of 3s and provided 13 points and five assists. Mouhamed Dioubate contributed 10 points and 11 rebounds. Labaron Philon had 10 points and five assists. Mississippi State (19-9, 7-8) was led by Josh Hubbard, who had 21 points on 8-of-22 shooting. KeShawn Murphy added 18 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Takeaways Mississippi State: The Bulldogs ended February with two atypically poor attempts at defending the 3-point line, allowing Oklahoma to make 11 of 26 before Alabama unloaded on Tuesday. Before the past two games, Mississippi State had not permitted an opponent to shoot better than 40% from 3-point range since Feb. 1. Alabama: Played much better defense than in consecutive losses this month to No. 1 Auburn and then-No. 15 Missouri, which shot a combined 53% from the field. Key moment Mississippi State coach Chris Jans called a timeout with just more than seven minutes remaining in the first half to stop a 10-4 Alabama run punctuated by Grant Nelson's dunk. In the minute following that timeout, Youngblood hit two 3-pointers, extending Alabama\u2019s lead to 20. The Crimson Tide led by 26 at halftime. Key stat Alabama shot far better from 3-point range than Mississippi State did from the field (28 for 73, 38%).

      "2025-03-08 - Arkansas: 93 vs Mississippi State: 92\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- \u2014 Jonas Aidoo made one of two free throws with 11 seconds left to break a tie game and No. 25 Mississippi State missed two potential game-winning shots at the rim at the other end to close out Arkansas\u2019 93-92 victory on Saturday. Mississippi State (20-11, 8-10 Southeastern Conference) used a 12-0 run to go up by one point with 3:14 to play, its first lead since before halftime. Arkansas (19-12, 8-10), which led by one at the break, opened the second half on a 10-run. DJ Wagner, who scored a game-high 24 points, gave the Razorbacks a three-point lead on a 3-pointer with 44 seconds left. But Jonathan Hubbard countered, hitting a 3-pointer for the Bulldogs just 10 seconds later to set up the frantic finish. Aidoo, a preseason second-team All-SEC selection, largely struggled in his first season with the Razorbacks after transferring from Tennessee. But he scored a season-high 21 points and had 10 rebounds in the regular-season finale. Claudell Harris Jr. led Mississippi State with 18 points and Hubbard finished with 17. Takeaways The Razorbacks entered the game likely on the right side of the NCAA Tournament bubble and should be breathing fine on Selection Sunday. Mississippi State should make the tournament, as well, but the Bulldogs have seen their seeding drop as they lost four of their last five games. Key moment Riley Kugel, who made the 3 that gave Mississippi State its first second-half lead, was blocked at the rim by Billy Richmond in the waning seconds. RJ Melendez grabbed the offensive rebound, but missed the putback as time expired. Key stats The Razorbacks shot well. They made 55% of their field goals, 43% of their 3-pointers and 81% of their free throws. The Bulldogs committed just two turnovers and scored 19 points off 10 Arkansas giveaways. Up next Arkansas will be either the No. 9 or No. 10 seed in next week\u2019s SEC Tournament. Mississippi State will be either the No. 10 seed or the No. 11 seed in the SEC Tournament. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Mississippi State (21-11) will move on to face seventh-seeded Missouri (21-10) in the second round on Thursday night. The Bulldogs shot 52% (35 of 67) overall, including 15 of 34 (44%) from long range. Hubbard finished 9 of 19 from the floor, while nine other Bulldogs scored at least five points.

Tony Perkins added a season-high 20 for the seventh-seeded Tigers (22-10), who will face No. 4 Florida on Friday night in the first tournament game for the Gators. Josh Hubbard paced Mississippi State (21-12), which was the No. 10 seed in the SEC, with 24 points and Keshawn Murphy added 18. Caleb Grill hit a 3-pointer as time expired in the first half, putting the Tigers up 39-34. Thursday\u2019s game was much closer than the only regular-season matchup against the Tigers, an 88-61 victory for Missouri in Starkville. Takeaways Mississippi State: The loss will strengthen the Bulldogs' already strong probability of receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Missouri: Playing their first game of the SEC Tournament, the Tigers had to battle most of the second half against Mississippi State, which kept the game close until the final minutes. Friday\u2019s matchup against the highly-ranked Gators should be a tougher test. Key moment Grill broke the 17th and final tie of the game with a dunk with 4:05 remaining in the second half to put the Tigers up 71-69. The dunk and the 3-pointer at the end of the first half were the only points Grill scored.

    "profile_summary": "Mississippi State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 8-seed with a 21-13 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on a spectacular nonconference run that gradually eroded under the weight of one of college basketball's toughest schedules. The Bulldogs went 12-1 before SEC play, notching quality nonconference wins over Memphis on the road, SMU away, and a dominant 90-57 dismantling of then-No. 18 Pittsburgh at home, and they reached as high as No. 14 in the AP Poll. Against ranked opponents this season, Mississippi State went a modest 5-9: notable wins include upsets of No. 21 Ole Miss (twice, including an overtime thriller), No. 7 Texas A&M by 16 points at home (prompting a court storm), and No. 21 Memphis on the road, while the losses include blowout defeats to No. 1 Auburn (88-66), No. 6 Alabama (111-73), No. 6 Tennessee (68-56), and No. 20 Missouri (88-61 at home) \u2014 a pattern that reveals a team that can steal a marquee win but frequently gets overwhelmed by truly elite opposition. The final five games tell a complicated story: Mississippi State beat LSU by 12 in the SEC Tournament opener, lost to Missouri 85-73 in the second round, and heading into Nashville had gone 1-3 \u2014 blowing a lead late at Arkansas in a 93-92 heartbreaker, losing at home to Texas in overtime 87-82 despite a furious second-half rally, and getting obliterated at Alabama 111-73 in a game that was never close. That stretch reflects the team's defining tension: they are scrappy, resilient comeback artists who refuse to quit (see their 12-0 run to briefly lead Arkansas late, or Kugel's buzzer-tying layup to force OT against Texas), but they are also prone to catastrophic defensive meltdowns \u2014 particularly against teams that shoot threes at volume, as Oklahoma (52.7% overall), Alabama (49% from three), and Missouri (55% from three) all torched them from deep in consecutive February-March losses.\n\nJosh Hubbard is the unquestioned engine of this offense \u2014 a preseason Wooden Award watch list honoree who erupted for a career-high 38 points against Alabama and has been virtually the only reliable creator in crunch time \u2014 but his inconsistency is a real concern: he shot just 2-for-12 in the blowout loss to Auburn and 4-for-18 (with 14 points) against SMU, showing a tendency to struggle when opponents key on him. KeShawn Murphy gives this team a legitimate interior presence, posting double-doubles regularly and providing 18 points and 11 rebounds in the Alabama loss, while Claudell Harris Jr. is a dangerous spot-up shooter off the bench who can turn a game with a flurry of threes. The bench overall is a genuine strength \u2014 Mississippi State outscored UNLV 48-13 off the bench in the Arizona Tip-Off and posted a 32-5 bench scoring edge in a road win at Georgia \u2014 but the team's identity shifts dangerously when Hubbard goes cold and no one steps into the vacuum. Locationally, the Bulldogs have been better away from Starkville than their home record suggests, going 2-4 in SEC home games while picking up road wins at Memphis, SMU, Vanderbilt, Ole Miss, and Georgia, though they also suffered their worst beatings (Auburn, Alabama) away from home; neutral-site performance is mixed \u2014 they won the Arizona Tip-Off semifinal impressively, lost the championship to Butler, and split two SEC Tournament games. As an 8-seed, Mississippi State carries real danger for a 1-seed \u2014 they play with fight, have experienced tournament-level moments, can erupt offensively on a good shooting night, and feature a player in Hubbard capable of a 30-point performance on any given night \u2014 but their three-point defense is alarmingly porous at the worst possible time, their overall record is just 21-13, and the evidence of second-half collapses and blowout losses against elite competition is hard to dismiss. The realistic ceiling for this team is the Round of 32: dangerous enough to upset a 1-seed in a shootout if Hubbard is locked in and the three-point defense holds, but too defensively inconsistent and too",

Baylor was within three points twice in the final minute, but Arizona made seven consecutive free throws in the final 49 seconds \u2014 and went 9 of 12 in the final 1:21. Takeaways Arizona, in its inaugural Big 12 season, completed a regular-season sweep of Baylor. The Wildcats are just behind league-leading Houston (21-4, 13-1), and a half-game ahead of No. 9 Texas Tech (20-5, 11-3). Baylor has alternated wins and losses over its last eight games, though this was the first defeat at home during that stretch. The Bears are 12-2 at home. Key moment Carter Bryant traveled for turnovers on consecutive Arizona possessions before a 3-pointer and then a defensive rebound that led to a fast-break layup for teammate Anthony Dell'Orso, who had 11 points. That was part of a 12-3 run late in the first half for a 41-31 lead. Key stat The Wildcats are 6-3 in true road games this season, and 28-14 under fourth-year coach Tommy Lloyd.

With six seconds left, Edgecombe missed a challenged shot near the rim in an attempt to tie it. Omier and Thomas wrestled for the loose ball and the possession arrow favored Cincinnati. On the inbound, Edgecombe fouled Mitchell sending him to the line with 1.2 seconds left. Mitchell missed the front end of a one-and-one, but his 7-foot teammate Aziz Bandaogo skied to swat the ball away as time expired. In the first half, Cincinnati turned a 22-17 deficit into a 35-24 lead with an 18-2 run that lasted close to seven minutes.

Knotted at 58, Wright drove the lane on Vasean Allette and drew his fifth foul with two seconds left. After Wright made both foul shots, TCU, which was out of timeouts, lost possession of the ball on a near length-of-the court inbounds pass. With Baylor now inbounding the ball, the Horned Frogs' David Punch fouled Omier with a second remaining. Omier made 1 of 2 for the final margin and Baylor failed to get off a shot. Baylor (18-12, 10-9) edged ahead of TCU (16-14, 9-10) on the NCAA Tournament bubble winning for the fifth straight year at TCU.

Jayden Dunn also scored 18 points for the Bears (19-13), who built a 20-point lead early in the second half and then cruised into a quarterfinal matchup with ninth-ranked and No. 2 seed Texas Tech on Thursday night. David N'Guessan had 20 points and Dug McDaniel finished with 14 for the Wildcats (16-17), who edged Arizona State in the first round but were unable to keep the momentum going against the same team that rallied from 12 down to beat them in January. The Bears ended the first half Wednesday night on a 9-0 run to take a 41-24 lead into the locker room. Kansas State was just 1 for 12 from beyond the 3-point arc at that point, and veteran forward Coleman Hawkins \u2014 who scored 26 points against the Sun Devils \u2014 was 0 for 4 from the field and quickly growing frustrated. Kansas State closed within 58-46 with 8 minutes to go, but Hawkins was whistled for a flagrant foul contesting Edgecombe's dunk, and Jeremy Roach added a basket after his foul shots to help Baylor pull away again.

VJ Edgecombe's attempt at a tying jumper at the buzzer missed off the glass.

Norchad Omier had 29 points and 15 rebounds for seventh-seeded Baylor (19-14). Takeaways Baylor: The Bears need more offense from players other than Omier.

    "profile_summary": "Baylor enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 9-seed with a 20-15 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects a team talented enough to compete with anyone, but too inconsistent to be trusted over a sustained tournament run. Against ranked opponents, the Bears went 5-13, with notable wins over No. 22 St. John's (a double-overtime buzzer-beater by Jeremy Roach), No. 11 Kansas (rallying from 21 down in one of the most stunning comebacks of the season), and No. 16 Arkansas, while suffering blowout losses to Gonzaga (101-63), Tennessee (77-62), and Iowa State (74-55) that exposed genuine structural vulnerabilities. Their final five games tell a mixed story: a gutty 71-61 win over Oklahoma State, a narrow 61-58 road victory at TCU, a 65-61 home loss to Houston despite leading at halftime, a 70-56 Big 12 Tournament win over Kansas State, and a heartbreaking 76-74 quarterfinal exit to Texas Tech \u2014 the second time Tech beat them this season. The Bears are not a team that dominates wire-to-wire; they are a streaky, comeback-fueled squad that can look elite in the second half and completely disengaged in opening halves, having trailed by 21 to Kansas, 20 to BYU, and 23 to Arizona before either rallying or folding.\n\nNorchad Omier is unquestionably Baylor's engine \u2014 the fifth-year forward posted 29 points and 15 rebounds in the Big 12 Tournament loss to Texas Tech and finished the season with 87 career double-doubles, second-most in NCAA history behind Tom Gola, making him one of the most dominant interior presences in the country. Freshman VJ Edgecombe has been explosive (28 points against BYU, 24 against Arizona, career-high 30 against Kansas State) but was hampered by a lower-body injury in February, and his availability and conditioning entering the tournament is a legitimate concern. Jeremy Roach provides veteran shot-creation and clutch moments \u2014 his buzzer-beater against St. John's and his late-game scoring against TCU are evidence \u2014 but he has been inconsistent shooting and also dealt with concussion protocol, missing four games. Robert Wright III has emerged as a crucial tertiary scorer and playmaker, setting a Baylor freshman assist record. Location matters enormously for this team: the Bears were 12-2 at home, a dominant force in Waco, but 0-4 against ranked opponents in true road games, including losses at Iowa State, Arizona, Houston, and UConn. Their neutral-site record is genuinely respectable \u2014 a near-miss against Tennessee, a thriller win over St. John's \u2014 suggesting the tournament environment won't rattle them. Still, foul trouble remains a recurring issue (Omier's four-foul game against Texas Tech was decisive), depth is thin with Houston outscoring Baylor's bench 24-1 in one game, and the Bears' inability to build first-half leads consistently is a pattern that will be ruthlessly exploited by prepared tournament opponents. Baylor is a dangerous, volatile 9-seed capable of a first-round upset, but their realistic ceiling is the Round of 32 \u2014 a team more likely to be someone else's bracket-buster story than to make a deep run themselves.",

Arkansas State (1-1) was led by 20 points from Kobe Julien and 18 from Taryn Todd. Takeaways Arkansas State: The Red Wolves proved why they were the coaches\u2019 pick to win the Sun Belt Conference and were able to push Alabama to the final minutes despite shooting 21.4% from 3-point range (6 for 28). Alabama: The Crimson Tide survived a game against Arkansas State, which is coached by former Nate Oats assistant Bryan Hodgson.

      "2024-11-16 - Purdue: 87 vs Alabama: 78\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- \u2014 Trey Kaufman-Renn scored a career-high 26 points and grabbed eight rebounds, and freshman C.J. Cox scored nine of his 11 points during a game-turning 13-0 run midway through the second half to help No. 13 Purdue get past No. 2 Alabama 87-78 on Friday night. The Boilermakers (4-0) have won 21 consecutive home games and 25 straight in November. They have not lost a regular-season nonconference game since December 2020. Braden Smith had 17 points and 10 assists as he moved into third place on Purdue's career assists list with 483. Fletcher Loyer also scored 17.

Grant Nelson added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Mark Sears scored 15 in a matchup between two of last season's Final Four teams. Takeaways Alabama: Coach Nate Oats rolled the dice playing such an early road game against a team so traditionally strong at home, especially in November. But the Crimson Tide learned lessons that will help them in the long run. Purdue: The Boilermakers might have turned the corner. After three straight rocky performances, coach Matt Painter\u2019s squad delivered its best game yet. If Purdue continues playing this way, it could be the Big Ten contender everyone expects. Key moment After Alabama took its largest lead at 65-59, Kaufman-Renn answered with a basket and Cox made three straight 3-pointers to fuel a 13-0 run that gave the Boilermakers a 72-65 advantage with 8:17 to play. They never trailed again. Key stats Purdue committed just three turnovers and beat the highest-ranked nonconference opponent in Mackey Arena history. The only other time it played a non-Big Ten team ranked in the top two came in the arena\u2019s first game \u2014 a 73-71 loss to No. 1 UCLA in December 1967.

After squandering an eight-point lead with 8:53 left in the game, and allowing Houston to force overtime, Alabama outscored the Cougars 7-2 in the extra frame for the win.

Youngblood was 7 for 11 beyond the arc, and Sears finished 5 for 12. Jarin Stevenson went 3 for 3 off the bench. Reserve guard Aden Holloway also drained a trio of 3s and provided 13 points and five assists. Mouhamed Dioubate contributed 10 points and 11 rebounds. Labaron Philon had 10 points and five assists. Mississippi State (19-9, 7-8) was led by Josh Hubbard, who had 21 points on 8-of-22 shooting. KeShawn Murphy added 18 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Takeaways Mississippi State: The Bulldogs ended February with two atypically poor attempts at defending the 3-point line, allowing Oklahoma to make 11 of 26 before Alabama unloaded on Tuesday. Before the past two games, Mississippi State had not permitted an opponent to shoot better than 40% from 3-point range since Feb. 1. Alabama: Played much better defense than in consecutive losses this month to No. 1 Auburn and then-No. 15 Missouri, which shot a combined 53% from the field. Key moment Mississippi State coach Chris Jans called a timeout with just more than seven minutes remaining in the first half to stop a 10-4 Alabama run punctuated by Grant Nelson's dunk. In the minute following that timeout, Youngblood hit two 3-pointers, extending Alabama\u2019s lead to 20. The Crimson Tide led by 26 at halftime. Key stat Alabama shot far better from 3-point range than Mississippi State did from the field (28 for 73, 38%). Up next Alabama visits No. 5 Tennessee on Saturday, while Mississippi State returns home to face LSU. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "2025-03-01 - Tennessee: 79 vs Alabama: 76\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Jahmai Mashack raced up the court and hit a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc at the buzzer to give No. 5 Tennessee a 79-76 victory over No. 6 Alabama on Saturday. The Volunteers (24-5, 11-5 Southeastern Conference) got the final shot by forcing a five-second inbounds violation under Alabama's basket with 3.8 seconds left. Chaz Lanier and Jordan Gainey each scored 18 points for Tennessee. Zakai Zeigler had 15, and Mashack finished with 11. Mark Sears led Alabama (23-6, 12-4) with 24 points. Labaron Philan had 13, and Aden Holloway added 11. Sears had 12 points in the first half to help Alabama take a 42-38 lead. Takeaways Alabama: It was a bold move for coach Nate Oats to re-work the framework of his team late in the season. Over the last four games, the Crimson Tide have gone to a three-guard starting lineup \u2014 inserting Labaron Philon along with Mark Sears and Chris Youngblood, while bringing Jarin Stevenson off the bench. The creative move has been successful so far. Tennessee: Big man Felix Okpara is becoming more involved in the offense. Coming into the Alabama game, he scored at least eight points in five of the last seven games and was in double figures three of those. Key moment With 3.8 seconds to play, Tennessee got the ball back on Alabama's inbounds violation. Key stat Alabama outrebounded the Vols 24-14 in the final 20 minutes, with a 13-7 advantage on the offensive end. Up next Both teams are in action Wednesday night. Alabama hosts Florida, and Tennessee is at Mississippi. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-03-06 - Alabama: 94 vs Florida: 99\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- \u2014 Alex Condon had 27 points and10 rebounds to lead No. 5 Florida to a 99-94 win over No. 7 Alabama on Wednesday night. The Gators (26-4, 13-4 Southeastern Conference) also got 22 points and eight assists from Walter Clayton Jr. Florida strengthened its NCAA Tournament resume with a second road win over a top 10 team, after beating No. 1 Auburn on earlier this season. It\u2019s the first time in program history the Gators have done it twice in one season. Mark Sears led Alabama (23-7, 12-5) with 30 points, six rebounds and five assists. Alabama also got 19 points from Labaron Philon, 11 from Clifford Omoruyi and 10 points each from Grant Nelson and Aiden Sherrell. Takeaways Florida: The win could put the Gators ahead of Tennessee in the race for the final No. 1 seed. Florida entered Wednesday one spot ahead of the Volunteers in the NET rankings that are heavily considered by the selection committee, and put the Gators alone in second place in the SEC. Alabama: The Crimson Tide are rarely beaten on the glass, but Florida outrebounded Alabama 50-35, including a 16-10 edge on the offensive end. Key moment Walter Jr. connected with Condon on two dunks within a minute of each other in the second half; the second one put the Gators up 12 with under eight minutes to go. Alabama was unable to bring the deficit to five points until the final 90 seconds of the game, and never got within a single possession. Key stat Clayton Jr. and Condon combined for 36 of Florida\u2019s 72 shot attempts from the field and 15 of its 29 free-throw attempts, carrying the Gators offensively. Up next Alabama finishes the regular season at No. 1 Auburn on Saturday, after the Tigers took just their second loss of conference play at Texas A&M on Tuesday. Florida hosts Ole Miss on Saturday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-03-08 - Auburn: 91 vs Alabama: 93\n\nAUBURN, Ala. -- \u2014 Mark Sears hit a game-winning floater as time expired, and No. 7 Alabama spoiled the home finale of rival and No. 1 Auburn with a 93-91 overtime road win Saturday. The off-balance buzzer-beater from the free-throw line was only the third made basket of the game for Sears, who finished with nine points. Alabama (24-7, 13-5 Southeastern Conference) got 23 points from Grant Nelson and 15 points each from Labaron Philon and Clifford Omoruyi. The win ended a two-game losing skid for Alabama and handed a second straight loss for Auburn (27-4, 15-3). Johni Broome scored 34 points, including a game-tying layup in the final minute of regulation and a game-tying 3-pointer with 15 seconds left in overtime. Tahaad Pettiford added 19 points for Auburn, which was without second-leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara for the final 10:52 of regulation and overtime. Baker-Mazara was ejected for a Flagrant 2 foul on Alabama\u2019s Chris Youngblood. Takeaways Alabama: The Crimson Tide will enter the postseason with much-needed momentum, and they did it without having to overly rely on Sears offensively. That\u2019s a great sign for Nate Oats\u2019 team, which got 52 points in the paint Saturday. Auburn: The Tigers will look back at their miscues in this game, including allowing 10 Alabama offensive rebounds for 18 second-chance points. Defensive rebounding was an issue for Auburn earlier this week in a loss to Texas A&M. Key moment Sears\u2019 game-winning shot put an end to a back-and-forth final stretch between two of the best offenses in college basketball this season. Key stat Both teams\u2019 star players logged heavy minutes. Sears played 40 minutes for Alabama, while Broome played 43 for Auburn. Up next As top-four seeds in the SEC Tournament, Auburn and Alabama will both open the postseason on Friday in Nashville, Tenn. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-15 - Alabama: 99 vs Kentucky: 70\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Labaron Philon scored 21 points and fifth-ranked Alabama never trailed in routing No. 15 Kentucky 99-70 on Friday night to advance to the Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals. The Crimson Tide (25-7), the No. 3 seed, will play fourth-ranked Florida on Saturday looking to play for their second tournament title in three seasons. The Gators beat No. 21 Missouri 95-81 earlier Friday night as the SEC's top four seeds all advanced. Jarin Stevenson added 16 points. Mark Sears, Mouhamed Dioubate and Aden Holloway each had 13 as Alabama beat the Wildcats again after sweeping them during the regular season. Kentucky (22-11) managed just one tie at 14 and trailed 45-38 at halftime. Andrew Carr led Kentucky with 18 points. Amari Williams had 16, and Travis Perry 11. Takeaways Kentucky: The Wildcats played without starting guard Lamont Butler who missed his ninth game of the season after hurting his right shoulder Thursday night. Coach Mark Pope said on pregame radio that they got the \u201cbest possible news\u201d from tests earlier Friday. ... The Wildcats go home with their last tournament title in 2018. Alabama: The Crimson Tide are two wins from their third tournament title in five seasons under coach Nate Oats. They improved to 3-17 against Kentucky in this event and 2-6 in the quarterfinals. They also added to the program record for most wins over AP Top 25 opponents with the 11th this season. Key moment The Crimson Tide extinguished any thoughts of a comeback starting the second half on a 12-6 run to force a Kentucky timeout after Dioubate's 3 with 16:31 left. Alabama led by 30 late. Key stat Alabama had a 29-6 scoring edge off turnovers. Up next Butler has time to heal for the NCAA Tournament for Kentucky. Alabama has a chance to avenge a 99-94 loss to the Gators on March 5 on the Tide's home court. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "2025-03-15 - Florida: 104 vs Alabama: 82\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- \u2014 Walter Clayton Jr. scored 22 points, and No. 4 Florida pulled away from No. 5 Alabama for a 104-82 victory in the Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals on Saturday. Alijah Martin and Will Richard each had 16 points for the Gators (29-4) in their fifth consecutive win. Next up for Florida is Sunday's SEC championship game against No. 8 Tennessee, which beat No. 3 Auburn 70-65 in the first semifinal. The second-seeded Gators led the Crimson Tide 47-45 after a first half that featured 10 lead changes. But Clayton and company really turned up their play down the stretch. Chris Youngblood had 14 points for third-seeded Alabama (25-8). Clifford Omoruyi and Mouhamed Dioubate each had 12. Clayton went 6 for 11 from 3-point range. The senior guard added six assists. Takeaways Alabama: The loss derailed the Crimson Tide\u2019s hope of winning the program's third SEC tournament title in the last five seasons. With 10 wins over AP Top 25 opponents this season, a program record for most in a single season, Alabama has a strong case for a good seed in the NCAA Tournament. Florida: The Gators were impressive in the defensive end, holding the high-scoring Crimson Tide to just 82 points. Entering Saturday, Alabama had scored 90 points or more in 18 games this season, the most in Division I. Key moment Richard hit a 3-pointer with 9:24 remaining in the second half to give Florida a 21-point lead and put the game out of reach for Alabama. Key stat After a tightly contested first half, Florida outscored the Crimson Tide 57-37 over the final 20 minutes. Up next Florida and Tennessee split the two-game season series, with both teams winning on their home courts.

    "profile_summary": "Alabama enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 2-seed with a 28-9 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on elite scheduling, remarkable depth, and a program-record 10 wins over AP Top 25 opponents. The Crimson Tide went roughly 10-7 against ranked opponents this season, with signature wins over then-No. 6 Houston (85-80 OT), then-No. 10 Texas A&M (94-88), then-No. 8 Kentucky (102-97), then-No. 25 Illinois (100-87), and a stunning buzzer-beating road win over then-No. 1 Auburn (93-91 OT) to close the regular season \u2014 the latter punctuated by Mark Sears' off-balance game-winning floater at the horn. Their losses against quality competition are equally instructive: back-to-back regular season defeats to No. 1 Auburn (94-85) and No. 15 Missouri (110-98) revealed vulnerability to elite offenses and turnover-induced collapses, and the SEC Tournament semifinal blowout loss to Florida (104-82) exposed a troubling inability to sustain momentum over 40 minutes against the nation's best. Over their final five games, Alabama went 3-2: a dominant 99-70 demolition of Kentucky in the SEC quarterfinals, a buzzer-beating OT road win at Auburn, and a regular season home win over Kentucky (96-83), sandwiched around demoralizing losses to Florida (99-94 at home) and Tennessee (79-76 on a half-court buzzer-beater). That inconsistency \u2014 oscillating between breathtaking highs and deflating lows within the same week \u2014 defines Alabama entering March.\n\nAlabama plays an explosive, high-tempo offensive style that regularly cracks 100 points, scoring 90 or more in 18 games this season (most in Division I), and relies heavily on attacking the free-throw line \u2014 drawing 41 attempts against Houston and 44 against Arkansas State \u2014 while also capable of erupting from three, as evidenced by going 22-of-45 from deep in a 111-73 demolition of Mississippi State. The engine of everything is senior guard Mark Sears, who posted 35 points at Missouri, 30 against Florida and Kentucky, 27 against Creighton and Texas A&M, and delivered the game-winning shot at Auburn \u2014 a legitimate All-American whose clutch gene is undeniable. Supporting him is a deep and versatile rotation featuring Grant Nelson (a double-double threat who scored 25 at Kentucky and 23 at North Dakota), freshman Labaron Philon (a dynamic playmaker averaging major minutes), Aden Holloway (five 3-pointers against Kentucky in the SEC tourney), Chris Youngblood (27 points and 7-for-11 from three vs. Mississippi State), and Clifford Omoruyi anchoring the interior. However, Alabama's Achilles heel is turnovers \u2014 they committed 21 against Ole Miss (a home loss), 19 against Kent State, 15 against Oregon, and 10 in the first half alone at Missouri \u2014 and those lapses directly translate to points allowed and momentum shifts. On the glass, Alabama is typically dominant, outrebounding opponents by significant margins, but Florida exposed them with a 50-35 rebounding edge in the SEC semis, a concerning outlier. Neutral-site data is mixed \u2014 they went 2-1 in the Players Era Festival (wins over Houston and Rutgers, loss to Oregon on a putback dunk with 4.4 seconds left) and won a SEC quarterfinal comfortably before collapsing against Florida \u2014 suggesting they are capable but not invulnerable in tournament environments. This Alabama team is a legitimate Elite Eight contender and a credible Final Four threat: Sears is playing at an All-American level, the depth and offensive firepower are elite, and wins over Houston, Texas A&M, Kentucky, and Auburn in overtime on the road demonstrate big-game DNA \u2014 but the chronic turnover issues, the blowout SEC semifinal loss to Florida, and a pattern of second-half defensive breakdowns against top offenses make a national title run a stretch. **Realistic ceiling: Elite Eight, with a puncher's chance at the Final Four if Sears stays locked in and turnovers are contained.**",

    "profile_summary": "Robert Morris enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 15-seed with a 26-9 record and Horizon League regular-season and conference tournament champions \u2014 an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a mid-major, though one built almost entirely against modest competition. The Colonials' most revealing result against quality opposition came in Game 1, a brutal 87-59 dismantling at West Virginia in which they trailed 30-2 after eight minutes and shot 32% in the first half \u2014 a performance that exposed real limitations against high-major athleticism and defensive intensity. Their conference schedule told a more favorable story: Robert Morris went 15-5 in Horizon League play, rattling off seven straight wins to close the regular season and adding three more in the conference tournament, including wins over Oakland (79-76) and Youngstown State (89-78), to capture the automatic bid. The final five games were dominant \u2014 wins over Wright State (83-62), Oakland (79-76), Youngstown State (89-78), and earlier blowouts of IU Indianapolis (106-53) and Green Bay (94-85) \u2014 with the Colonials winning by an average of roughly 16 points per game in that stretch, signaling a team playing its best basketball at exactly the right time. Robert Morris wins in a variety of ways: they grind out clutch victories in close games \u2014 Kam Woods' go-ahead jumper with two seconds left at Youngstown State, a game-winning basket by Woods against Towson, and a triple-overtime survival against Northern Kentucky all illustrate a team that competes hard and late \u2014 but they can also pull away convincingly when the talent gap is wide enough.\n\nThe engine of this team is a genuinely talented trio. Alvaro Folgueiras is a force \u2014 he dropped 35 points and 10 rebounds at Northern Kentucky, put up 27 and 16 against Saint Francis, and posted a 21-point, 19-rebound effort in triple overtime against Northern Kentucky, demonstrating elite production as both a scorer and rebounder for this level. Amarion Dickerson is a high-motor two-way player who delivered 27 points and 15 rebounds in that triple-OT thriller and has been consistently productive with multiple 20-plus-point performances down the stretch. Kam Woods is the team's best creator, capable of takeover moments \u2014 29 points at Oakland, 22 in the conference tournament \u2014 and he is as clutch as anyone on the roster, evidenced by multiple game-winning plays. Josh Omojafo provides reliable scoring off ball-movement and is an elite free-throw attacker. Depth beyond those four is a legitimate concern, with role players like Ryan Prather Jr. and DJ Smith contributing but not consistently threatening. Locationally, Robert Morris has been notably stronger at home (where they rarely lost after mid-January) but showed they can win on the road with victories at Northern Kentucky, Youngstown State, Milwaukee, and Cleveland State late in the year \u2014 a good sign for a neutral-site tournament. However, there are no ranked wins on this r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and the West Virginia blowout remains the starkest data point about how this team holds up against elite opposition. Robert Morris is a legitimate threat to make some noise as a 15-seed \u2014 their clutch-game experience, three-headed star power, and scorching late-season form make them more dangerous than a typical 15 \u2014 but the talent ceiling against a high-major 2-seed is almost certainly prohibitive. **Realistic tournament ceiling: First-round exit, with a puncher's chance at an upset if Folgueiras and Woods are at their peak.**",

      "2025-02-26 - Oklahoma State: 74 vs Iowa State: 68\n\nSTILLWATER, Okla. -- \u2014 Abou Ousmane scored 25 points and Oklahoma State beat No. 9 Iowa State 74-68 on Tuesday night. Arturo Dean had 14 points and seven steals, and Bryce Thompson added 11 points for the Cowboys (14-14, 6-11 Big 12). A crowd that grew as the game progressed celebrated by storming the court. Oklahoma State had no previous wins over AP Top 25 teams this season under first-year coach Steve Lutz. The Cowboys lost their previous two games against ranked opponents Texas Tech and Kansas by a combined 70 points. Josh Jefferson scored 17 points and Nate Heise added 13 for Iowa State (21-7, 11-6). The Cyclones were trying to bounce back from a loss at then-No. 5 Houston on Saturday. Keshon Gilbert, the team's No. 2 scorer this season, sat out with a muscle strain. Curtis Jones, who leads Iowa State with just over 17 points per game, was held to 11 on 2-for-8 shooting. Oklahoma State ran out to a 12-4 lead as Iowa State made just one field goal in the first five minutes. The Cowboys rolled to a 40-26 halftime lead behind 12 points from Ousmane. Iowa State trimmed it to 44-39 before Brandon Newman made an off-balance, contested shot in the lane to help the Cowboys regain control. That sparked a 7-0 run that led to an Iowa State timeout. Oklahoma State pushed its lead to 56-41, then hung on at the end. Takeaways Iowa State: The Cyclones are 14-1 at home, but 5-5 on the road and 2-1 at neutral sites. They'll have to improve away from Ames if they're going to make a postseason run.

The Cyclones (23-8, 13-7 Big 12) led wire-to-wire. They got 14 points from Joshua Jefferson and 11 points from Dishon Jackson. Kansas State (15-16, 9-11) was led by senior David N'Guessan with 19 points. Dug McDaniel had 14 points. The Wildcats shot just 37.7% from the field and 9.5% from 3-point range. Takeaways Iowa State: The Cyclones remembered the first meeting between the two teams, when they jumped out to an early lead only to see the Wildcats take an 80-61 win, snapping the Cyclones' 29-game home winning streak. The Cyclones led by 11 early in the first half and never allowed the Wildcats back in the game. Kansas State: The Wildcats need to find consistency to even have a chance at postseason play. Key moment Kansas State closed the first half on an 8-0 run to trim the halftime deficit to 34-26. But the Wildcats couldn't carry the momentum into the second half.

      "2025-03-12 - Iowa State: 76 vs Cincinnati: 56\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 Joshua Jefferson had 19 points, Dishon Jackson added 10 points and 15 rebounds, and No. 12 Iowa State leaned on its big men to beat Cincinnati 76-56 in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament on Wednesday. Tamin Lipsey scored 16 before leaving late with an apparent groin injury and Milan Momcilovic had 13 for the No. 5 seed Cyclones (24-8), who will play fourth-seeded BYU in the quarterfinals in a rematch of last week's double-overtime thriller. Iowa State guard Keshon Gilbert returned from a muscle strain that had kept him out of three of the past five games, including a win over Kansas State to end the regular season. He had three points in 11 first-half minutes but did not play after halftime. His availability, along with Lipsey's status, loom important as the Cyclones chase another Big 12 title. Jizzle James led the No. 13 seed Bearcats (18-15) with 17 points, but he missed his final six shots, which helped allow Iowa State finish the game on an 11-0 run. Josh Reed added 10 points and Day Day Thomas finished with nine. The Cyclones overcame 17 turnovers by dominating the glass, outrebounding the Bearcats 41-23. That led to a 36-16 advantage in points in the paint, where Cincinnati's 7-foot Aziz Bandaogo and 6-foot-8 Dillon Mitchell combined for just four points. Takeaways Cincinnati got 18 points and 15 rebounds from Mitchell in an 87-68 first-round victory over Oklahoma State. But the inability of him and Bandaogo to score against the 6-11 Jackson and 6-9 Jefferson was crucial to the outcome. Iowa State committed 18 turnovers against the Bearcats in a regular-season win. The Cyclones will need to hold onto the ball much better if they want to win a seventh Big 12 Tournament title. Key moment Cincinnati closed within 51-47 with 10:40 to go, but Iowa State scored on its next three trips to regain control. Key stats Iowa State was 10 of 21 from beyond the 3-point arc.

      "2025-03-13 - BYU: 96 vs Iowa State: 92\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- \u2014 Richie Saunders scored 23 points, hitting a crucial 3-pointer with less than a minute to go, and No. 17 BYU overcame a big game from Curtis Jones in a 96-92 victory over No. 12 Iowa State in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 Tournament on Thursday. Fousseyni Traore added 15 points and Trevin Knell had 14 for the fourth-seeded Cougars (24-8), who went 18 of 36 from beyond the arc to set a tournament record for made 3-pointers, and advanced to play No. 2 Houston or Colorado in the semifinals. Jones hit seven 3s of his own and scored 31 points, and Milan Momcilovic had 18 for the short-handed Cyclones (24-9), who had won their last four games at the Big 12 tourney, including their run to the championship a year ago. No. 5 seed Iowa State played without Keshon Gilbert, their second-leading scorer and top distributor, and point guard Tamin Lipsey, who had started all 101 games he had played in his career. Gilbert tried to play through a muscle strain against Cincinnati but went only 11 minutes, while Lipsey strained his groin in the closing minutes of the second-round win. BYU was without Kanon Catchings, who missed his third consecutive game after hurting his knee against West Virginia. The Cougars and Cyclones nevertheless picked up where they left off last week, when BYU ruined senior day at Iowa State in a double-overtime thriller. They raced up and down the floor, combined to hit 20 first-half 3-pointers, and Jones poured in 22 points \u2014 and hit eight straight shots at one point \u2014 to help the Cyclones to a 53-49 lead at the break. The Cougars still trailed 72-64 with 12 1/2 minutes to go when they went on an 11-0 run, and Mihailo Boskovic's 3-pointer gave them a 75-72 lead. Iowa State tied the game again moments later but was never able to regain the lead. BYU finished it off in the final minute from the foul line, where it was 18 of 21 for the game. Takeaways Iowa State was cautious with its two star guards in the hopes that they can be healthy for the NCAA Tournament. Gilbert was ruled out early and watched in street clothes while Lipsey tried to warm up but never entered the game. BYU committed 29 turnovers when it beat Iowa State last week. It had only 10 in the quarterfinal rematch. Key moment Saunders hit his third 3-pointer with 49.1 seconds left to give BYU a 92-88 lead. Momcilovic missed at the other end, and the Cougars were able to control the game the rest of the way. Key stats The teams combined for 31 3-pointers, which also set a Big 12 Tournament record.

    "profile_summary": "Iowa State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 3-seed with a 25-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine Big 12 quality but undermined by a turbulent second half and a brutal injury situation heading into March. Against ranked opponents, the Cyclones went an impressive 7-5, with notable wins over then-No. 5 Marquette (81-70), then-No. 9 Kansas (74-57 at home and 79-69 in Boulder), No. 25 Baylor (74-55), and No. 22 Arizona (84-67), but suffered losses to Auburn, West Virginia, Kansas, Kansas State, Houston, Oklahoma State, Arizona, and BYU \u2014 a mixed bag that reveals a team capable of beating anyone on a given night while also being susceptible to opponents who force turnovers and impose physicality. Over their final five games, Iowa State went 3-2: a statement 84-67 home win over Arizona, a deflating double-overtime home loss to BYU 88-85 on Senior Day, a wire-to-wire 73-57 win at Kansas State, a solid 76-56 Big 12 Tournament win over Cincinnati, and then a 96-92 quarterfinal exit at the hands of BYU \u2014 producing a pattern of inconsistency and a concerning inability to close out BYU in two separate high-scoring shootouts. The Cyclones' identity is multifaceted: they can grind defensively \u2014 leading the country in scoring defense early in the season \u2014 but they also run and gun, with six players capable of scoring 20-plus on any night and a team-wide tendency to generate steals and force turnovers at an elite rate (16 steals in the UCF win, 18 in the BYU regular-season loss). However, they are alarmingly turnover-prone themselves, committing 18 or more turnovers in multiple losses and surrendering damaging transition points as a result.\n\nThe player availability situation is the defining concern entering the tournament: second-leading scorer and primary distributor Keshon Gilbert (muscle strain) played only 11 minutes in the Big 12 Tournament before being ruled out, and starting point guard Tamin Lipsey \u2014 who had started all 101 games of his career \u2014 strained his groin and never entered the quarterfinal against BYU. Curtis Jones, who leads the team at just over 17 points per game, has been brilliant at times \u2014 scoring 31 in the BYU quarterfinal loss and 33 against Arizona State \u2014 but his supporting cast without Gilbert and Lipsey is clearly diminished. Joshua Jefferson (career-high 30 vs. UCF), Milan Momcilovic (returned from a hand injury to provide 17-18 points in recent games), and Dishon Jackson (15 rebounds vs. Cincinnati) give Iowa State legitimate frontcourt depth, and the Cyclones are 14-1 at home but only 5-5 on the road \u2014 a split that matters less in a neutral-site tournament though it signals fragility away from Ames. The team has shown genuine resilience \u2014 coming back from 13 down at Texas Tech, 13 down at Iowa \u2014 but they have also been blown out at home by Kansas State (80-61) and at Kansas (69-52) when their offense and turnover margin collapsed simultaneously. If Gilbert and Lipsey are healthy, Iowa State is a legitimate Sweet 16 or Elite Eight threat with the firepower and defensive IQ to beat anyone in the bracket; if either remains compromised, the Cyclones are a dangerous but flawed 3-seed whose realistic ceiling is the Sweet 16, with a first or second-round upset loss entirely plausible against a team that can pressure the ball and exploit their turnover issues.",

      "2024-11-05 - Duquesne: 72 vs Lipscomb: 77\n\nPITTSBURGH -- \u2014 Jacob Ognacevic had 30 points and 10 rebounds to lead Lipscomb past Duquesne 77-72 on Monday night in a season opener. Will Pruitt scored 15 points while shooting 4 of 7 from the field and 7 for 9 from the line and added six rebounds for the Bisons. Gyasi Powell went 4 of 5 from the field to finish with 12 points. Tre Dinkins led the Dukes in scoring, finishing with 16 points. Maximus Edwards added 14 points, nine rebounds and two steals for Duquesne. Jahsean Corbett also had 12 points and six rebounds.

      "2024-11-07 - Arkansas: 76 vs Lipscomb: 60\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- \u2014 John Calipari won his debut as Arkansas coach when the 16th-ranked Razorbacks held off a second-half rally by Lipscomb and pulled away for a 76-60 victory Wednesday night. Freshman guard Boogie Fland scored 17 points and Florida Atlantic transfer Johnell Davis added 15 for Arkansas. Calipari, who left Southeastern Conference rival Kentucky after last season, had previously been booed incessantly whenever stepping foot in Bud Walton Arena. That all changed when Eric Musselman, who coached Arkansas to three Sweet 16s in five seasons, departed last spring and Calipari bolted from the bluegrass of Kentucky for the foothills of the Ozarks. His new team looked a lot like his old ones. Lipscomb (1-1), the Atlantic Sun preseason favorite, put a scare into the Razorbacks (1-0) with a second-half run to pull within four points with just under seven minutes to play. Arkansas had led by 15 in the second half. Zvonimir Ivisic, one of seven players to make their Razorbacks debut Wednesday, hit a 3-pointer, a layup and two free throws in the span of a minute to stop the Bisons. Ivisic finished with 12 points. Jacob Ognacevic led Lipscomb with 16. Takeaways Lipscomb: The Bisons put up enough of a fight to suggest their projection as A-Sun champions is not farfetched. Arkansas: The Razorbacks might be as deep as any team in the country and the statistical totals backed that up. Calipari & Co. will need time to coalesce, but the team looks to be as dangerous as expected. Key moment Arkansas closed the first half on a 10-2 run to build a 39-28 lead at halftime. Key stats Arkansas outscored the Bisons 23-5 on fast-break points and 54-24 in the paint. The Razorbacks shot 68% inside the 3-point line, offsetting a 4-of-19 performance from beyond the arc. Up next Lipscomb hosts Wofford on Saturday. Arkansas gets its first power-conference challenge of the season Saturday when the Razorbacks travel to Dallas for a neutral-site game against No. 8 Baylor, which is coming off a 101-63 loss at No. 6 Gonzaga. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

They made seven of their first 11 shots and finished 34 of 62 from the field, including 12 for 25 from behind the 3-point arc. The rout came a day after Kentucky vaulted 10 spots in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, a jump helped by a 77-72 win over No. 6 Duke in Atlanta that gave first-year coach Mark Pope a signature win. Jacob Ognacevic had 17 points and Will Pruitt added 12 for the Bisons (2-5), who struggled to string together consecutive baskets in the first half and dropped their third consecutive game. Robinson shot 6 of 10 overall and 3 for 6 from deep. Amari Williams had 11 rebounds and nine points as Kentucky dominated on the glass, 43-28. Takeaways Lipscomb: The Bisons entered having lost two of three by single digits. Their cold start ensured the game wouldn't be close as they missed 10 consecutive shots after their first basket, including eight in a row from behind the arc. Kentucky: It\u2019s the first time Kentucky has made double-digit 3s in each of its first four games. Key moments Lipscomb started 9 of 34 (26%) from the field and 2 for 19 from 3-point range while falling into a big hole early. Key stat In addition to their strong shooting, the Wildcats committed just eight turnovers \u2014 only two after halftime. Up next Kentucky hosts Jackson State on Friday night.

    "profile_summary": "Lipscomb enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 14-seed with a 25-10 record, having claimed the Atlantic Sun Conference regular season title and punched their ticket through the conference tournament. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9, however, carries significant asterisks when viewed through a national lens. Against Power Conference opponents, the Bisons went 0-3 \u2014 losing to #9 Kentucky by 29 (97-68), to Arkansas by 16 (76-60), and to Western Kentucky by five \u2014 with only the Arkansas game featuring a competitive second half before the Razorbacks pulled away. Those performances reveal a genuine gap between Lipscomb and high-major competition, which will matter enormously against a 3-seed opponent in the first round. Within the Atlantic Sun, however, Lipscomb was dominant and legitimate, finishing 14-4 in conference play and winning the conference tournament, including a 84-66 quarterfinal rout of Central Arkansas behind Joe Anderson's 28 points and a 76-65 final over North Alabama. Their final five game summaries \u2014 wins over Austin Peay (95-78), Central Arkansas in the regular season finale (78-60), Central Arkansas in the A-Sun tournament (84-66), the A-Sun tournament semifinal (result implied), and a 76-65 win over North Alabama in the tournament final \u2014 show a team playing its best basketball at exactly the right time, riding a four-game winning streak with commanding margins and balanced scoring contributions.\n\nLipscomb's identity is built almost entirely around Jacob Ognacevic, one of the more dangerous mid-major scorers in the country. The senior forward has posted a stunning string of performances throughout the year \u2014 30 points against Duquesne, 32 against Middle Tennessee, 32 against Bellarmine, 31 against Austin Peay, 30 against Stetson, 28 against Austin Peay again, and 20-plus in the conference tournament \u2014 and enters the tournament as a genuine first-round concern for any opponent's scouting staff. Will Pruitt and Gyasi Powell provide credible secondary scoring, and Joe Anderson adds defensive activity (seven steals against Jacksonville alone) and perimeter shooting that makes the offense multidimensional. Stylistically, Lipscomb wins through offensive volume and Ognacevic's individual brilliance rather than elite defense or lockdown schemes; they are capable of high-scoring shootouts and have shown the ability to build comfortable leads, but they have also been susceptible to teams that can match their pace and exploit their defensive limitations \u2014 evidenced by losses to Eastern Kentucky (twice), North Alabama, and Middle Tennessee within conference play. Location-wise, the Bisons are functional on the road and at neutral sites, going through their conference tournament on their home floor in Nashville and generally performing well there, but their worst blowout losses (Kentucky, Arkansas) came away from home. As a 14-seed, Lipscomb is a dangerous first-round opponent \u2014 Ognacevic alone gives any 3-seed a genuine problem to solve \u2014 but the ceiling here is realistically a first-round upset followed by a second-round exit; the quality-competition losses are too lopsided and the defensive profile too soft to project this team advancing to the Sweet 16.",

    "profile_summary": "Memphis enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 5-seed with an impressive 29-6 record, having won the outright American Athletic Conference regular-season title \u2014 their first conference championship since 2012-13 \u2014 and the AAC Tournament crown, knocking off Wichita State, Tulane, and UAB in consecutive games to close the season on a scorching run. Against quality competition, the Tigers built a genuinely compelling r\u00e9sum\u00e9: they own ranked wins over then-No. 2 UConn (99-97 OT in the Maui Invitational), then-No. 16 Clemson (87-82 OT on the road), No. 21 Virginia (64-62 on the road), and No. 16 Ole Miss (87-70 at home), going approximately 5-4 against ranked opponents with losses to No. 4 Auburn (90-76 in the Maui title game), unranked Arkansas State at home (85-72, a brutal upset), unranked Mississippi State at home (66-79), and No. 14 ranked Wichita State on the road in overtime (84-79). The home losses to Arkansas State and Mississippi State are genuine red flags \u2014 both came as ranked games in which Memphis was flat, shot poorly, and never seriously threatened, exposing a troubling vulnerability to being caught disengaged on their own floor. Their five most recent games, however, tell a different story entirely: wins of +3, +1, +12, +5, and +16 in a stretch capped by the AAC Tournament run, suggesting a team that has found its footing and is peaking at precisely the right moment.\n\nMemphis is built around a dynamic backcourt duo in PJ Haggerty and Tyrese Hunter, supplemented by a versatile frontcourt anchor in Dain Dainja \u2014 a combination that gives them multiple avenues to win on any given night. Haggerty, one of the nation's top scorers at over 22 points per game, is a relentless attacker who draws fouls (Memphis went 40-for-29 in free throw attempts in the UConn OT win alone) and can manufacture points in clutch moments, as evidenced by his 21-point second-half eruptions at Virginia and against East Carolina. Hunter is a legitimate perimeter weapon \u2014 he went 7-of-10 from three against UConn and hit the go-ahead triple in overtime at Clemson \u2014 while Dainja has evolved into a dominant interior force, posting 22-point, 11-rebound performances and shooting 10-of-12 or better from the field in multiple outings. Colby Rogers provides a reliable third scoring option off three-point shooting, and Moussa Cisse brings rebounding and rim protection. The team's identity is that of a resilient, comeback-capable squad that wins with defensive pressure \u2014 forcing turnovers in bunches and converting them into transition points \u2014 but they are prone to sluggish starts, turnovers (a season-high 22 in the UTSA game), and inexplicable first-half collapses that put them in early holes. They have proven repeatedly they can claw back \u2014 erasing double-digit deficits against Missouri, San Francisco, Clemson, UAB, and Virginia \u2014 but their inability to consistently sustain focus for 40 minutes has cost them at home. On the road and at neutral sites, Memphis is actually a different animal: their only true road losses came in the Maui Invitational title game against an undefeated No. 4 Auburn team and in overtime at Wichita State, while they went a sterling 4-0 in true road games against ranked opponents including Clemson and Virginia. The UConn and Michigan State wins at Maui confirm that neutral-site tournament basketball suits their style. Memphis is a legitimate Elite Eight contender and a dark-horse Final Four threat: dangerous, experienced in high-pressure situations, equipped with star power that can carry them past elite competition, but just inconsistent enough in focus and turnover control to remain vulnerable to an upset if they come out flat.",

    "profile_summary": "Colorado State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 12-seed with a 26-10 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on Mountain West Conference dominance but punctuated by real vulnerabilities against elite competition. The Rams finished second in the MWC at 16-4 and won the conference tournament, defeating Nevada, Utah State, and Boise State in succession to punch their ticket to the Big Dance on a nine-game win streak. Against genuinely quality opponents, however, the picture is mixed: Colorado State lost to ranked Ole Miss by 15 on a neutral site, was blown out at Colorado (72-55) and at Utah State (93-85), fell to VCU and Washington, and was upset at home by UC Riverside \u2014 losses that reveal a team capable of being overwhelmed by superior athleticism and early-game pressure. Their only ranked win of note came against Utah State in the MWC Tournament semifinals, a dominant 83-72 performance that saw the Rams lead wire-to-wire after jumping ahead 49-30 at the half. The final five games tell an encouraging story: wins over Boise State (83-73), Nevada in the MWC quarterfinals (67-59), Utah State (83-72), and Boise State again in the conference title game (69-56), all controlled and decisive performances, capped by Nique Clifford's career-high 36-point outburst in the regular-season finale at Boise State.\n\nClifford is the unambiguous engine of this team \u2014 a do-everything forward who is posting massive lines night after night, regularly contributing 20-plus points, double-digit rebounds, and five-plus assists while providing shot-blocking and defensive versatility. His 26 points and 11 rebounds against Utah State in the semis and 25 points and 14 boards against Nevada in the quarterfinals demonstrate that he elevates in big moments, and he gives Colorado State a legitimately elite individual weapon. The supporting cast is functional but streaky: Jalen Lake provides perimeter shooting and big-shot capability (he hit the walk-off 3-pointer to beat Boise State in January), Kyan Evans can get hot from three, and Jaylen Crocker-Johnson and Rashaan Mbemba contribute energy and efficient scoring off the bench. The Rams are capable of wire-to-wire blowouts at home \u2014 they dominated teams like UNLV (84-62), Wyoming (88-53), and Fresno State (91-64) in Fort Collins \u2014 but on the road and at neutral sites against physical, well-coached opponents, they have shown a troubling tendency to fall into deep early holes they cannot escape. Stylistically, they play a pace-and-share offense that can ignite quickly, but they are also capable of going cold for long stretches, and their defense has been porous against elite guards. Location matters here: the Rams are noticeably more comfortable at home and have struggled consistently when forced to play in hostile road environments. Entering the tournament on a nine-game winning streak with Clifford playing the best basketball of his college career, Colorado State is a legitimate threat to pull off a first-round upset as a 12-seed \u2014 but their inability to stay competitive against high-major, athletically superior opponents in non-conference play makes a deep run unlikely. **Realistic ceiling: Round of 32, with a first-round upset well within reach \u2014 but a Sweet 16 appearance would require Clifford to carry an enormous load against a level of competition that has consistently exposed this roster's limitations.**",

      "2024-11-05 - Duke: 96 vs Maine: 62\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Star freshman Cooper Flagg had 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists in his college debut, and No. 7 Duke beat Maine 96-62 on Monday night in the season opener for both teams. The 6-foot-9, 205-pound Flagg \u2014 the nation\u2019s top-ranked recruit and a preseason Associated Press All-American \u2014 made 6 of 15 shots and all six of his free throws. Fellow rookie Kon Knueppel powered the offense with 22 points and three 3-pointers for the Blue Devils (1-0), who shot 55.6% for the game. Quion Burns scored 15 points for the Black Bears (0-1), which shot just 6 for 24 (25%) after halftime as Duke pulled away. Takeaways Maine: The Black Bears were picked fourth in the America East, their highest projected finish since the 2010-11 season. They hung around in the first half (45.5% shooting) but everything was a struggle after the break. Duke: The Atlantic Coast Conference favorite had six players score in double figures, including returnees Caleb Foster (11) and Tyrese Proctor (10). Key moment Duke pulled away with an 11-0 run in the second half. Knueppel made a corner 3 off a feed from Flagg and Sion James scored twice in the paint to push the margin to 60-39 with 14:33 left. Key stat Knueppel, a 6-7 wing, had 15 points on 5-for-8 shooting with a pair of 3s by halftime. That included a 4-point play in transition that had him outscoring Maine 13-9 in those opening 7 1/2 minutes as Duke ran out to a double-digit lead. Up next The Blue Devils host Army on Friday in a home tuneup before facing No. 23 Kentucky in next week's Champions Classic in Atlanta.

      "2024-11-08 - Duke: 100 vs Army: 58\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Cooper Flagg had 13 points and 11 rebounds and No. 7 Duke rolled to a 100-58 victory over Army on Friday night. Khaman Maluach had 11 points and 14 boards for the Blue Devils (2-0). Kon Knueppel added 15 points, Tyrese Proctor tallied 14, Sion James had 12 and Caleb Foster scored 11 for Duke. For Army (1-1), Jalen Rucker scored 17 points, while Josh Scovens added 16 points and seven rebounds. Former Army and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, a West Point graduate and the all-time winningest coach in the history of Division I men's college basketball, sat courtside at Cameron Indoor Stadium with his wife Mickie. Takeaways Duke: Flagg only played 25 minutes and seemed to be battling cramps on the sideline in the second half, using a massage tool on his hamstrings and guzzling Gatorade. Against more marquee opponents, Duke will need the preseason AP All-American to be available for the entirety of the game. Army: The Black Knights allowed Duke to make 17 3-pointers, more than the Blue Devils made in any game last season. Key moment Flagg dunked a lob from Proctor to complete a fast-break alley-oop after James stole the ball from Army. Flagg's two-handed transition slam ignited a 29-7 Duke run over the next 13 minutes. Key stat Duke dominated on the glass and inside, outscoring the undersized Black Knights 36-18 in the paint and 17-7 on second-chance points. The Blue Devils outrebounded Army 50-32. Up next The Blue Devils face their first major conference opponent of the season Tuesday, taking on No. 23 Kentucky in Atlanta the same day the Black Knights return home to host Division III Mount Saint Mary. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-13 - Kentucky: 77 vs Duke: 72\n\nATLANTA -- \u2014 Otega Oweh knocked down four free throws in the final 10.3 seconds and No. 19 Kentucky claimed the first big win of Mark Pope\u2019s coaching tenure, knocking off No. 6 Duke 77-72 in the Champions Classic on Tuesday night. In the frenetic closing seconds, Duke (2-1) tied the game at 72 on Cooper Flagg\u2019s lay-in with 1:14 remaining but never got off another shot. Flagg ruined a 26-point night by turning it over twice in the final minute to hand the victory to the Wildcats (3-0). Oweh had a steal that led to a pair of free throws, then snatched away an offensive rebound off a missed free throw by Lamont Butler, drawing another foul that set up two more free throws with 0.5 seconds left. Andrew Carr paced Kentucky with 17 points, while Oweh added 15. It was a huge win for Pope, a former Kentucky player who returned to his alma mater after the departure of long-time coach John Calipari. Takeawa ys Duke: The Blue Devils turned it over only seven times all night, but Flagg's miscues at the end cost them a chance to pull out the victory. Kentucky: The Wildcats showed plenty of balance. Only three players reached double figures but nine players registered on the scoresheet. Key moment With Duke trailing 74-72, Flagg stumbled as he dribbled into the corner and wound up putting his hand on the end line while trying to regain his balance, turning the ball over to the Wildcats with 5 seconds remaining. Key stat Duke was just 4 of 23 from 3-point range, while the Wildcats made 10 of 25 beyond the arc. Up next Duke returns home to face Wofford on Saturday.

      "2024-11-16 - Duke: 86 vs Wofford: 35\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Tyrese Proctor scored 15 points and No. 6 Duke bounced back from its first loss of the season with an 86-35 victory over Wofford on Saturday, when the Blue Devils allowed their fewest points since 1960. Duke (3-1), which was coming off a 77-72 loss to No. 19 Kentucky in the Champions Classic, led by as many as 51 points in their most lopsided victory of the season. Isaiah Evans contributed 14 points, Caleb Foster had 13 and Khaman Maluach added 11. Duke opened a 39-point lead in the first half and held Wofford to 24.6% shooting for the game. The Terriers (1-3) went more than six minutes without scoring in the first half as the Blue Devils rolled into the break up 51-14. Kyler Filewich and Corey Tripp scored 12 apiece for Wofford. Takeaways Wofford: The Terriers, picked to finish fourth in the Southern Conference, dropped their third straight game and head to the Cream City Challenge seeking their first win over a Division I opponent this season. Duke: The Blue Devils put on a defensive clinic, allowing season lows in points and field-goal percentage. The 35 points bested the 37 they gave up in games in 2002 and 1997. Key moment Wofford\u2019s offense went into hiding in the first half, going six minutes and 17 seconds between points. A Tripp jumper with 5:06 remaining ended the drought, which saw the Terriers miss eight consecutive shots during a 17-0 Duke run. Key stat Cooper Flagg entered as Duke\u2019s leading scorer (19.0) but struggled offensively, managing only five points in the first half on 2-of-5 shooting. However, Flagg contributed in other ways with a team-high six rebounds, three assists and two steals before halftime. He finished with eight points. Up next Wofford travels to Milwaukee to play St. Thomas on Friday, when Duke visits No. 9 Arizona for its next Top 25 tilt. ------ This story corrects that Isaiah Evans had 14, not 11, points for Duke. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-23 - Arizona: 55 vs Duke: 69\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. -- \u2014 Cooper Flagg scored 24 points, Kon Knueppel added 13 and the pair of freshmen led No. 12 Duke past No. 17 Arizona 69-55 on Friday night. Flagg drove the lane and threw down a one-handed jam in traffic to give the Blue Devils a 46-33 lead with 12:27 left. The preseason All-America pick shot 10 of 22 from the field and added six rebounds and three assists. Duke (4-1) never trailed in the second half. Arizona (2-2), which has lost two straight, cut the margin to 54-48 on Jaden Bradley's layup with 5:40 left but couldn't get closer. Bradley led the team with 18 points, while KJ Lewis added 12. Duke led 34-27 and had a 22-14 rebounding advantage at halftime, closing on a 6-0 run. Takeaways Duke: The Blue Devils handled their first true road game with poise despite having three freshmen in the starting lineup. The physical performance against a team with a pair of 7-footers bodes well for the future. Arizona: The Wildcats were bothered by Duke's size, strength and athleticism, losing lots of 50-50 battles for loose balls and offensive rebounds. Key moment Knueppel grabbed his own offensive rebound, dribbled out to the perimeter and then hit a 3-pointer to give the Blue Devils a 42-31 lead with 15:33 left. It was Duke's first double-digit lead of the night. Key stat Arizona's Caleb Love \u2014 a preseason All-America selection along with Flagg \u2014 finished with just eight points on 3-of-13 shooting. Love averaged nearly 17 points per game in eight previous games against the Blue Devils, dating back to his time at North Carolina. Up next Duke plays No. 1 Kansas on Tuesday in Las Vegas, and Arizona plays Davidson on Wednesday in the Bahamas. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-11-27 - Duke: 72 vs Kansas: 75\n\nLAS VEGAS -- \u2014 Dajuan Harris scored 14 points and top-ranked Kansas withstood the ejection of star center Hunter Dickinson to beat No. 11 Duke 75-72 in the Vegas Showdown on Tuesday night. Dickinson, who entered the game averaging 17.8 points and 10.4 rebounds, received a fragrant-2 foul and was ejected for kicking the Blue Devils\u2019 Maliq Brown in the head midway through the second half. Highly touted Duke freshman Cooper Flagg took advantage of Dickinson's absence, and the Blue Devils kept it close all the way to the buzzer. Zeke Mayo added 12 points for Kansas (6-0), and Dickinson and AJ Storr each scored 11. Tyrese Proctor led Duke (4-2) with 15 points, Flagg scored 13, Kon Knueppel had 11 and Sion James finished with 10. Mayo put Kansas ahead for good when he made a jumper with 1:57 left for a 73-71 lead. Flagg hit a free throw for Duke and Rylan Griffen answered with two foul shots with 2 seconds left. Kansas has won four of the past five meetings with the Blue Devils and six of eight. Nine of the past 10 meetings have been decided by single digits. Takeaways Kansas: Overcoming the loss of Dickinson could serve the Jayhawks well later in the season. Duke: Flagg had six points when Dickinson went out, but then on four trips to the lane had two dunks, a layup and a free throw. Key moment Knueppel had a 3-point try rim out at the buzzer that would have forced overtime. Key stat Duke shot 50% from the field and 42.3% from 3-point range. Kansas shot 49.1% overall and 47.1% from 3. Up next Kansas hosts Furman on Saturday. Duke is home against Seattle on Friday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2024-12-05 - Duke: 84 vs Auburn: 78\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Freshman sensation Cooper Flagg had 22 points and 11 rebounds to help No. 9 Duke push past No. 2 Auburn 84-78 on Wednesday night in the SEC/ACC Challenge. The preseason Associated Press All-American had 16 points after halftime to help the Blue Devils (6-2) hold off the Tigers and fellow All-American Johni Broome. Broome had 20 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out with 15 seconds left for the Tigers (7-1), who missed seven straight shots in the final 4 1/2 minutes. That helped Duke keep tenuous control in front of its rowdy home crowd. Still, the SEC won the intraconference series in a 14-2 romp, with Duke and Clemson registering the ACC's lone wins. Takeaways Auburn: The Tigers pushed Kansas for the No. 1 ranking after winning the Maui Invitational. But after Kansas lost at Creighton on Wednesday night, the Tigers followed shortly afterward in a March-worthy matchup. Duke: The Blue Devils dug out from an early 11-point hole and repeatedly came up with timely responses to stay in control, leading by a dozen after halftime. Key moment Duke's lead was just two when Flagg drove for a contested shot that was blocked, with the ball knocked loose out beyond the 3-point arc as the shot clock wound down. But teammate Tyrese Proctor collected the ball for a long straightaway 3-pointer to beat the horn for a 73-68 lead with 4:30 left. Key stat Freshman guard Isaiah Evans didn't play in Duke's matchups against Kentucky, Arizona or Kansas and had just 29 points all season. But he came out of nowhere to score 18 points and shoot 6 of 8 on 3s before halftime for a game-changing spark off the bench, though he didn't score after the break. Up next The Tigers host Richmond on Sunday. That same day, the Blue Devils open Atlantic Coast Conference play at Louisville. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2024-12-08 - Louisville: 65 vs Duke: 76\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- \u2014 Cooper Flagg scored 13 of his 20 points in the second half and No. 9 Duke came back from a 14-point first-half deficit to beat Lousiville 76-65 on Sunday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for both teams. The Blue Devils (9-2, 1-0) trailed 30-16 midway through the first half but eventually wore down the Cardinals (5-4, 0-1), who lost their third straight. Flagg led Duke with 12 rebounds. Tyrese Proctor scored 13 for the Blue Devils and Kon Knueppel had 12. Terrence Edwards Jr. led Louisville with 21 points. Reyne Smith pitched in 13, and Khani Rooths finished with 10. Takeaways Duke: Duke took Louisville\u2019s best punch early, and coming off an emotional win against No. 2 Auburn on Wednesday, it could have gotten ugly. However, the Blue Devils whittled their way back from down 14 in the first half to score an impressive road victory. Louisville: Coach Pat Kelsey preached all season that the Cardinals were better perimeter shooters than their stats showed. They started well and kept Duke on the ropes for most of the game, but the Cardinals' short bench due to injuries led to Louisville running out of gas. Key Moment Flagg drew his fourth foul with 10:36 left in regulation, and Louisville\u2019s lead was down to 53-50. Despite his absence, the Blue Devils went on a 13-2 run to take the lead for the first time since the first minute of the game. By the time he returned nearly six minutes later, Duke led 68-60. Key Stat Louisville hit seven of its first nine 3-pointers to build the 30-16 lead. However, the Cardinals finished making just 11 of 31 3s overall.

      "2024-12-11 - Duke: 72 vs Incarnate Word: 46\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Khaman Maluach scored a season-high 17 points and No. 4 Duke beat Incarnate Word 72-46 on Tuesday night. Maluach \u2014 a 7-foot-2 freshman center from South Sudan \u2014 shot 6 of 7 from floor and had seven rebounds as the Blue Devils (8-2) won their fourth straight. Isaiah Evans scored 14 points and Kon Knueppel 10. Jalin Anderson and Dylan Hayman each scored 11 points for Incarnate Word (5-5). Duke played without second-leading rebounder Maliq Brown, who is day-to-day with toe injury. The Blue Devils won the rebounding battle 44-26 and outscored the Cardinals 30-14 in the paint.

The Blue Devils (10-2, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) led by double figures much of the game and dominated the second half against the Yellow Jackets (5-7, 0-2). Even though the game was in Atlanta, it sounded more like Cameron Indoor Stadium with all the blue-clad Duke fans roaring for their team. They certainly had plenty to cheer about. Knueppel led Duke's fabulous freshmen class, which also got 15 points from Khaman Maluach. Baye Ndongo led Georgia Tech with 14 points.

The Mustang shot 34% from the field (23 of 67) and their only lead was 3-2 after Cross made a 3-pointer on their first shot. Takeaways Duke: The Blue Devils had quick responses each time SMU appeared to be making a run. The first was after an early 10-point lead was trimmed to 18-16. Flagg then had a jumper and a 3-pointer. \u2026 Duke was in Texas for the first time since losing to N.C. State in an Elite Eight game played at the NBA Dallas Mavericks\u2019 arena about 5 miles away. SMU: With a sellout crowd, even with students not back from winter break, the Mustangs couldn\u2019t generate any Moody magic for an early signature win with Enfield. Key moment After a jumper by Cross to open the second half and get SMU within 41-34, Flagg scored nine points in less than three minutes. That was part of a 13-3 Duke run.

Takeaways Notre Dame: The Irish fell in a 14-0 hole in this one and trailed by as many as 18 in the second half before getting it to a two-possession game late. Duke: The Blue Devils have been blowing through the first chunk of the league slate, shooting 51.6% while winning four of their first five ACC games by 20 or more points.

Tyrese Proctor added 20 points for the Blue Devils (16-2, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). But the person drawing the pro scouts and a sellout crowd \u2014 the bulk of them Duke fans \u2014 was Flagg, who was playing his first college game in New England since leaving Maine for Tobacco Road. Chad Venning scored 19 for Boston College (9-9, 1-5). Duke has beaten BC in 10 consecutive meetings since the Eagles upset the top-ranked Blue Devils in Conte Forum on Dec. 9, 2017.

Duke responded with seven straight scoring possessions, going up 53-47 on Flagg's two free throws with 3:53 left. Harris scored 14 points to lead the Demon Deacons (15-5, 7-2), who had the backing of a loud and festive home crowd eager to storm the court against Duke for the second straight year.

Fellow rookie Kon Knueppel had 19 points for the Blue Devils (18-2, 10-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who have won 14 straight games. And they had to fight the entire way to get there. That's because the Wolfpack (9-11, 2-7) played loose and fearlessly to build a 13-point first-half lead and then stay within reach of Duke every time the Blue Devils tried to push free in the final 10 minutes. Dontrez Styles scored 18 points for N.C. State, which shot just 32% after halftime but matched its season high with 10 3-pointers. This was a rematch of an NCAA Tournament Elite Eight game won by the Wolfpack during the program's improbable Final Four run last year. The game also had a pair of stoppages in the last 4 1/2 minutes for health reasons, first when Duke freshman center Khaman Maluach vomited on the baseline during play and then when one of the \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d fans apparently fainted and had to be carried out of the bleachers.

By the time Knueppel scored in the lane over Ian Jackson, the Blue Devils led 23-6.

Key moment Rohde rifled a perfect pass to a cutting Taine Murray for what appeared destined to be a back-door layup for the Cavaliers. Instead, Flagg swatted the shot away. Duke got a 3-pointer from Tyrese Proctor at the other end, part of a 16-2 run that put the Blue Devils ahead 27-14 with 8:19 left in the first half. Key stat One of the ACC\u2019s best rivalries over the past decade was no contest on this night. From 2012-23, no Virginia-Duke game had a margin of victory greater than 10 points. That run ended last year at Duke when the Blue Devils rolled 73-48. Up next Duke faces Illinois in a nonconference matchup at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday night, while Virginia plays at North Carolina. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-02-23 - Illinois: 67 vs Duke: 110\n\nNEW YORK -- \u2014 Cooper Flagg had 16 points in his Madison Square Garden debut and seven players scored in double figures for No. 3 Duke in a 110-67 blowout Saturday night that marked the most lopsided loss in Illinois history. Isaiah Evans paced the Blue Devils (24-3) with 17 points in 18 minutes off the bench, and Kon Knueppel added 15. Duke built a 23-point lead in the first half and scored its most points since a 113-49 win over Stetson in December 2018. Flagg, the freshman star expected to be the top pick in this year's NBA draft, added seven rebounds and five assists in 23 1/2 minutes. But the Blue Devils didn't even need his best while rolling to their largest victory at MSG. Tre White had 16 points for Illinois (17-11) in a nonconference matchup between programs that reached the Elite Eight last year. Kasparas Jakucionis scored 14. Takeaways Illinois: Hampered recently by illnesses and an injury to forward Morez Johnson Jr., the Fighting Illini have faded following a 12-3 start. They've lost three straight \u2014 by an average of 26 points to teams ranked in the top 11 at the time. Duke: Eyeing a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the Blue Devils boast one of the nation's stingiest defenses. They delivered an outstanding performance on that end of the floor in their first game since defensive stopper Maliq Brown dislocated his left shoulder in Monday's win at Virginia. Key moment After getting whistled for two fouls in the first 11:18 of a quiet first half, Flagg opened the second period with a fast-break dunk. He added another jam minutes later and gave the Duke throng in a sellout crowd of 19,812 what it came to see. Key stat Illinois missed its first 17 attempts from 3-point range and finished 2 for 26 from beyond the arc. Up next Illinois: Will resume Big Ten play at home Tuesday night against Iowa. Duke: Will visit Miami on Tuesday night. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-02-26 - Miami: 60 vs Duke: 97\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. -- \u2014 Kon Knueppel scored 20 points, Cooper Flagg and Isaiah Evans each added 16 and No. 2 Duke rolled past Miami 97-60 on Tuesday night. Flagg, the likely No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, added six assists and five rebounds for the Blue Devils (25-3, 16-1 Atlantic Coast Conference). Duke led by 15 at the half, and Knueppel scored eight points in a 16-2 burst by the Blue Devils early in the second half to push the lead to 65-36. Lynn Kidd scored 17 points and Jalil Bethea had 13 for Miami (6-22, 2-15), which was without guard Matthew Cleveland. Miami has lost four games by 35 or more points this season, after having four such losses from 1987 through 2024. Takeaways Duke: The Blue Devils have won five straight, those wins coming by an average of 31 points. This was the Blue Devils\u2019 13th win by 25 or more points this season. Miami: The Hurricanes' 22 losses are two shy of the school's single-season record with three conference games remaining. Miami went 8-24 in 1991-92. Key moment Evans made three consecutive 3-pointers in a span of 1:40 in the first half, the first two immediately answering 3-pointers made at the other end by Bethea. Evans' third one gave Duke a 29-14 lead. Key stat The win improved coach Jon Scheyer\u2019s record at Duke to 79-21, the best through 100 games in school history. Vic Bubas was 76-24 in his first 100 games at the school; Mike Krzyzewski was 52-48 at that point in his Duke career. Up next Both teams play Saturday, about 8 miles apart.

      "2025-03-02 - Duke: 100 vs Florida State: 65\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Isaiah Evans scored 19 points and No. 2 Duke overcame freshman star Cooper Flagg's injury scare to rout Florida State 100-65 on Saturday night. Flagg sat out more than 11 minutes to end the first half, twice leaving the gym to be evaluated after he was struck in the face on a hard foul. Flagg was on the court for the first 12 minutes of the second half, when he racked up 12 of his 16 points. Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach both had 14 points to help Duke (26-3, 17-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) maintain a one-game lead over Clemson in the league standings. Jamir Watkins had 21 points and Jerry Deng added 12 points for Florida State (16-13, 7-11). The Seminoles have lost three straight and four of five. Duke led 14-11 when Flagg departed. The Blue Devils built a 47-30 halftime lead. Takeaways Florida State: The Seminoles have given up more than 90 points twice this season, with both coming in a six-day span after they were drilled by North Carolina on Monday. Duke: The Blue Devils were without starting guard Tyrese Proctor, who sustained a knee injury Tuesday night at Miami. With Flagg out, they still had enough firepower to extend their lead and remain unbeaten at home this season, aided by a season-high 21 offensive rebounds. Key moment Nearly four minutes into the second half, Flagg blocked a shot, resulting in a fast break and Knueppel\u2019s three-point play for a 62-35 lead. Key stat Duke had 12 assists on 16 first-half baskets without committing a turnover despite unusual lineup combinations. Up next Duke plays its home finale Monday night against Wake Forest.

      "2025-03-04 - Duke: 93 vs Wake Forest: 60\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- \u2014 Freshman Cooper Flagg had 28 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in possibly his final home game, helping No. 2 Duke beat Wake Forest 93-60 on Monday night to clinch at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title. Fellow rookie Kon Knueppel added 17 points for the Blue Devils (27-3, 18-1), who led by 13 at halftime and then blew the game open midway through the second half. The 6-foot-9 Flagg, a potential No. 1 overall NBA draft pick, checked out with 3:34 left. He greeted coach Jon Scheyer with a high-five and a hug as Duke's \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d chanted \u201cOne more year! One more year!\u201d Efton Reid III and Ty-Laur Johnson each scored 14 points to lead the Demon Deacons (20-10, 12-7). Takeaways Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons had weakened their case for an NCAA bid by losing three of five to unranked teams, twice at home. They needed this Quadrant 1 win to help their postseason resume, but instead heard with chants of \u201cNIT! NIT!\u201d from the Crazies. Duke: The Blue Devils entered the night with a one-game lead on No. 11 Clemson and No. 14 Louisville in the ACC. They're now a win from taking the regular-season race outright. Key moment Duke led 47-38 before going on an 18-3 tear. That included a burst of three 3-pointers, the first from Sion James followed by a pair on consecutive possessions by Mason Gillis that pushed Duke ahead 65-41. Key stat Duke shot 53.8% after halftime and made 8 of 19 3-pointers, pushing the Blue Devils to a total of 14 3s for the game. Up next Both teams close the regular season Saturday.

      "2025-03-08 - North Carolina: 69 vs Duke: 82\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- \u2014 Freshman Kon Knueppel scored 17 points to help No. 2 Duke beat rival North Carolina 82-69 on Saturday night and clinch the outright Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title. Cooper Flagg added 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists despite first-half foul trouble for the Blue Devils (28-3, 19-1). Duke blew a 15-point first-half lead and trailed by seven midway early after the break, but responded with 12 consecutive points to turn the game and silence a roaring hostile crowd. The Blue Devils are now in position to rise to No. 1 in Monday's AP Top 25 poll with top-ranked Auburn losing its past two games. Fifth-year senior RJ Davis scored 20 points in his final home game for Tar Heels (20-12), who were blown out in the first meeting but responded with far more resilience this time before Duke asserted control to stretch out the lead in the final seven minutes. Takeaways Duke: The Final Four favorite completed the first 19-1 regular-season slate since the ACC moved to 20 games in 2019-20. UNC: The Tar Heels had won six straight coming in with their best play of the season to play their way back into better positioning for an NCAA bid. But this was their last certain chance to add a resume-topping win to help that case. Key moment UNC led 59-53 when Duke made its move with 12 straight points in a 15-2 burst that put the Blue Devils ahead to stay. That included Knueppel's backdoor layup for the lead, while versatile defender Maliq Brown had a big 3-pointer in his return from injury that pushed Duke to a 68-61 lead with 8 1/2 minutes left. Key stat UNC missed 22 of its last 27 shots in the final 15-plus minutes as Duke made its move. Up next The ACC Tournament starts Tuesday in Charlotte. Duke opens play as the 1-seed in Thursday's quarterfinals. UNC is the 5-seed and will play in Wednesday's second round. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here.

      "2025-03-13 - Duke: 78 vs Georgia Tech: 70\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Kon Knueppel scored 28 points as No. 1 Duke overcame injuries to star Cooper Flagg and Maliq Brown to beat Georgia Tech 78-70 on Thursday and advance to the ACC Tournament semifinals. Isaiah Evans scored 14 points on four 3-pointers and Khaman Maluach added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Blue Devils (29-3), who have won nine straight. Flagg appeared to land awkwardly on Baye Ndongo\u2019s foot as he came down with a rebound late in the first half. The ACC player of the year retreated to the Duke bench and punched a seat in frustration. After being helped to the locker room, Flagg returned to the Duke bench in the second half without a boot on his foot. He did not return to the game. Brown went down with a shoulder injury in the first half. Duncan Powell led Georgia Tech (17-16) with 24 points. Duke missed its first 13 shots from beyond the arc and fell behind 26-12, matching the season's largest deficit. They trailed 26-17 when Flagg left the game, but cut the lead to five at halftime. Duke pushed its lead to seven early in the second half when Tyrese Proctor stole a pass and delivered a high-flying one-handed dunk in transition. Takeaways Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets bench was outscored 21-6. Duke: The Blue Devils showed they have some firepower without Flagg and Brown on the court. After missing its first 13 3s, Duke went 7 of 17 the rest of the way. Key moment Knueppel drove, scored and drew a foul for a 3-point play with about five minutes left in the game to put Duke up by 11. Key stat Georgia Tech was outscored 28-12 to start the second half. Up next Georgia Tech can hope for an NIT bid. Duke will face the North Carolina, a 68-59 winner over Wake Forest, on Friday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "2025-03-14 - Duke: 74 vs North Carolina: 71\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Kon Knueppel scored 17 points and No. 1 Duke held off a furious second half rally by North Carolina to beat its rival for the third time this season, 74-71 on Friday night to reach the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament championship game. Khaman Maluach added 13 points and nine rebounds, and Sion James had 12 points for the Blue Devils, who played without star Cooper Flagg. Duke (30-3) will play the winner of the second semifinal between No. 10 Clemson and No. 13 Louisville in the title game. After North Carolina cut a 24-point, second-half deficit to one, Ven-Allen Lubin had two free throws with 4.1 seconds left to potentially give the Tar Heels (22-13) the lead. But he missed the first and had the second made free throw waved off after teammate Jae'Lyn Withers stepped in the lane too early. Knueppel made two free throws with 2.8 seconds left and Lubin missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. It's the first time since 2001-02 that Duke has beaten North Carolina three times in a season. The Blue Devils swept the Tar Heels in the regular season that year and then beat them in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals en route to winning the national championship. Lubin had 20 points and 10 rebounds for North Carolina. Takeaways North Carolina: The Tar Heels simply don't have the size to match up with the Blue Devils, but showed plenty of heart with the comeback Duke: The Blue Devils showed they have plenty of punch and more than enough defense despite being without Flagg and top reserve Maliq Brown. Key moment Withers stepping the lane too early was a monumental mistake. Key stat UNC started the second half 15 of 24 from the field. Up next Duke will play the winner of No. 10 Clemson-No. 13 Louisville winner in the championship. UNC hopes it has done enough to get an NCAA Tournament berth. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

    "profile_summary": "Duke enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as the consensus No. 1 overall seed with a 35-4 record and the ACC regular-season and tournament titles in hand \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that places them among the most complete teams in the country. Against ranked opponents, the Blue Devils went an impressive 7-4, with marquee wins over then-No. 2 Auburn (84-78), No. 17 Arizona (69-55), No. 10 Clemson in the ACC Tournament final (73-62), and No. 13 Louisville (74-71 and 73-62) bracketing losses to No. 19 Kentucky (77-72), No. 1 Kansas (75-72), and No. 18 Clemson (77-71) in the regular season \u2014 three games decided by a combined nine points. Those losses reveal a vulnerability against elite, disciplined opponents in close-game situations, particularly when Cooper Flagg is hampered or commits late-game turnovers, as he did against Kentucky. The five most recent games (ACC Tournament quarterfinal through the title game and final regular-season stretch) tell a story of remarkable resilience: Duke beat Georgia Tech 78-70 without Flagg after he left with a foot injury, then outlasted North Carolina 74-71 in the semis \u2014 again without Flagg \u2014 before dispatching Louisville 73-62 in the championship. Those back-to-back wins without their best player are among the most encouraging data points of the season and speak to genuine depth. Flagg's status entering the tournament is the central health concern; he was listed as limited but available, and when healthy he has been transcendent, setting an ACC freshman scoring record with a 42-point performance against Notre Dame (11-of-14 shooting, 16-of-17 from the line) and posting 13 double-doubles across the season. He is surrounded by a legitimately dangerous supporting cast: Kon Knueppel (28 points in the ACC quarterfinal win without Flagg) is a high-efficiency freshman wing capable of taking over games, Tyrese Proctor provides veteran scoring punch, and 7-foot-2 freshman Khaman Maluach gives Duke a physically imposing interior presence. Defensively, Duke has been elite all season \u2014 ranked first in KenPom's adjusted defensive efficiency early in the year \u2014 and the Blue Devils held opponents to season lows in point totals with regularity, including a stunning 86-35 dismantling of Wofford and a 110-67 destruction of Illinois at Madison Square Garden, the most lopsided loss in Illini history. Duke is a wire-to-wire dominant team that can also grind: they came back from 14 down at Louisville, from 11 down at Boston College, and erased large deficits against NC State and North Carolina in the regular season finale, signaling composure and adaptability rather than a team that folds under pressure \u2014 though late-game turnover issues, specifically Flagg's costly miscues against Kentucky and Clemson, remain a real concern in tournament survival situations. Locationally, the Blue Devils were virtually unbeatable at home (14-0 in Cameron), solid on the road (going 8-2 away from Durham including impressive wins in Tucson and at Chapel Hill), and dangerous on neutral courts, winning the ACC Tournament in Charlotte while handling marquee neutral-site games in Las Vegas, New York, and Atlanta competitively. Injury monitoring will be critical \u2014 beyond Flagg's foot, Maliq Brown dislocated his shoulder and Tyrese Proctor missed time with a knee injury late in the season \u2014 but the Blue Devils have shown they can win without any one piece. **Duke is a legitimate national championship contender.** The combination of a historically great freshman class led by a generational talent in Flagg, elite defense, tournament-tested depth, and the resilience to win without their star player gives this team a ceiling that reaches the final weekend in San Antonio \u2014 and the evidence strongly suggests they will be there.",

Braden Huff scored 18 points in just his second start of the season as Gonzaga avenged two regular-season losses to Saint Mary's, beating the 19th-ranked Gaels 58-51 in the West Coast Conference Tournament championship on Tuesday night.

Saint Mary\u2019s was attempting to become the first team since San Diego in 1996-97 to beat Gonzaga three times in a season. But Gonzaga entered the game with the higher Kenpom rating, ninth to 22nd for the Gaels, and was a 3 1/2-point favorite at Sportsbook. \u201cYou've got to go through some hardships in order to win,\u201d Battle said. \u201cWe've been practicing for this moment. I think we were prepared more than ever going into this tournament, so I'm happy we were able to hoist the trophy.\u201d Takeaways Gonzaga: The Bulldogs committed just four turnovers while forcing 18 that included two shot-clock violations in the closing minutes.

    "profile_summary": "Saint Mary's enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 7-seed with a 29-6 record and the outright WCC regular-season title \u2014 a program-best 17-1 conference mark that speaks to genuine dominance within their league, even if questions linger about how they stack up against elite national competition. Against quality opponents, the Gaels went 1-2 in notable non-conference tests: a narrow 77-74 win over Nebraska in Sioux Falls and a road victory at Utah (72-63), but losses to Arizona State (64-68) and Boise State (65-67 in OT) revealed vulnerabilities against athletic, physical teams that can pressure them into mistakes. Their ranked wins are limited \u2014 Nebraska and Utah appear to be the most credible scalps \u2014 while the loss to Gonzaga in the WCC Tournament final (51-58) was damning: Saint Mary's went 0-for-16 from three, committed 18 turnovers, and went over seven minutes without a field goal in the second half, becoming the first ranked team since 2011 to combine those two statistics in a single game. Over their final five games (wins over LMU 58-55, Oregon State 74-64, and Pepperdine 74-59, followed by the Gonzaga WCC final loss), the Gaels were mostly grinding out victories rather than imposing their will \u2014 the LMU win required a Murauskas shot-clock-beating corner three with 30 seconds left, and they shot just 38% in that game \u2014 before the tournament finale exposed serious perimeter shooting fragility and turnover issues under elite defensive pressure.\n\nSaint Mary's is built around two standout players: Augustas Marciulionis, the two-time WCC Player of the Year who regularly puts up 17-25 points with elite assist and steal numbers, and Paulius Murauskas, a versatile big who can erupt for 29-30 points on nights he's dialed in from three (his 6-for-10 three-point performance at Utah was exceptional), though his shot-making is inconsistent \u2014 he is just a 31% three-point shooter on the season. Mitchell Saxen provides a reliable interior presence (double-doubles throughout conference play), and Mikey Lewis offers valuable bench scoring, including a 5-for-7 three-point performance in the win at Gonzaga during the regular season. The Gaels win by controlling the glass (they outrebounded LMU 43-26, including 12-2 on the offensive boards), playing disciplined half-court offense, and grinding opponents into low-scoring games \u2014 they held 27 of 32 opponents under 70 points. However, they are collapse-prone in the right circumstances: the WCC final showed they can completely fall apart from the perimeter, and their turnover issues (18 in the Gonzaga loss) are a legitimate concern against high-pressure defenses they'll see in March. Location-wise, Saint Mary's is dominant at home (strong throughout WCC play), solid on the road (wins at Utah, Gonzaga in the regular season, Oregon State), but their neutral-site record is mixed \u2014 the Arizona State loss in Palm Springs and the Gonzaga WCC final loss in Las Vegas suggest they haven't consistently translated their regular-season dominance to neutral courts. Saint Mary's is a dangerous, well-coached team with enough star power and rebounding toughness to beat a higher seed \u2014 but their three-point shooting volatility, turnover vulnerability against elite defenses, and limited r\u00e9sum\u00e9 against top-25 competition make a deep run unlikely. **Realistic tournament ceiling: Round of 32 to Sweet 16, with a first-round upset of a 10-seed well within reach, but a second-round matchup against a high-major athletic team likely ends their run.**",

Vanderbilt fans stormed the court again after the win, a repeat from a week ago when the Commodores (16-4, 4-3 Southeastern Conference) knocked off then-No. 6 Tennessee. The first court-storming led to a $250,000 fine from the league. Jason Edwards led Vanderbilt with 18 points, Devin McGlockton added 14, Nickel finished with 11 and Jaylen Carey 10. Kentucky (14-5, 3-3) lost consecutive games for the first time this season. Otega Oweh led the Wildcats with 21 points and 12 rebounds. Ansley Almonor had 12, Jaxson Robinson added 11. Vanderbilt secured its first win over Kentucky at Memorial Gym since 2016. Takeaways Kentucky: Turnovers were the Wildcats' undoing. They had 17 compared to just five by Vandy, and point guard Lamont Butler had six of those before fouling out. Vanderbilt: First-year coach Mark Byington has helped bring the magic back to Memorial. This was the second straight sellout at the SEC's oldest basketball arena and the Commodores' first since the 2011-12 season. Key moment After leading 41-27 at halftime, Kentucky outscored the Commodores 31-10 and took its biggest lead at 58-51 lead.

Vanderbilt led 38-27 late in the first half before Oklahoma closed on a 9-2 run to cut the deficit to 40-36 at the break. Oklahoma controlled the second half. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Brycen Goodine and Moore put the Sooners up 52-42 with 16:31 remaining, and a timeout by Vanderbilt didn't help. By the end of Oklahoma's 23-0 run, the Commodores had missed eight consecutive shots. Vanderbilt's Tyler Tanner sliced through the lane for a one-handed jam that cut Oklahoma's lead to 60-52 with about 10 minutes to go, but Oklahoma regrouped and expanded its lead.

Fellow guard Alijah Martin gave the Gators another scare when he tweaked his left hip in the first half. Martin returned but was hardly a factor. Richard and Condon, meanwhile, carried Florida (19-3, 6-3 Southeastern Conference). Richard hit 5 of 7 shots from 3-point range, and Condon chipped in nine rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots. Seldom-used guard Urban Klavzar also had a couple of big baskets, draining back-to-back 3s with about eight minutes to play to give Florida a nine-point advantage. He added an assist on the next play. Coach Todd Golden\u2019s team cruised from there and surely will point to this game as evidence of its depth. Jason Edwards led the Commodores (16-6, 4-5) with 20 points. Jaylen Carey added 15 points before fouling out. Takeaways Vanderbilt: The Commodores played solid defense throughout and looked as if they might pull off an upset. Ultimately, their inability to defend the 3-point line down the stretch was their undoing. Florida: Florida took a cautious approach with Clayton, especially with a road trip to top-seeded Auburn on tap Saturday. Key moment Florida made 10 of 11 shots over a 9-minute span in the second half to put the game away. Key stat Klavzar entered the night having made 3 of 16 shots from 3-point range.

He has scored in double figures in five of the last eight games and has proven to be productive as a rebounder. Carey was instrumental in igniting the Vanderbilt offense early against Tennessee. Tennessee: Last year, Dalton Knecht was good enough to help the Vols through the games in which shots weren\u2019t falling. The 2022-23 and this season have been more challenging.

    "profile_summary": "Vanderbilt enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 10-seed with a 20-13 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that vastly exceeded preseason expectations after the Commodores were picked to finish last in the SEC. Against ranked opponents, Vanderbilt went an impressive 5-6, with signature home wins over #6 Tennessee (76-75), #9 Kentucky (74-69), #24 Ole Miss (77-72), #12 Texas A&M (86-84 on the road), and #14 Missouri (97-93 in overtime) \u2014 a collection of upsets that gave first-year coach Mark Byington genuine tournament credibility. That said, the Commodores also absorbed blowout losses to #4 Alabama (103-87), #1 Auburn (80-68), #5 Florida (86-75), and #17 Kentucky (82-61), exposing a significant ceiling against truly elite competition. Recent form is a concern: over the final five games, Vanderbilt went 2-3, beating unranked Arkansas (loss, 90-77), ranked Missouri (win, 97-93 OT), ranked Texas A&M (win, 86-84), then losing at Georgia (79-68) and falling in the SEC Tournament's first round to 13-seed Texas (79-72) \u2014 a deflating exit that raises real questions about readiness. The Commodores play an uptempo, high-scoring style that thrives in chaotic, close games; their best wins have come down to final possessions, with clutch sequences like Nickel's buzzer-tying three against Missouri and McGlockton's game-winning and-one against South Carolina illustrating their scrappy, resilient identity. Jason Edwards is the unquestioned engine, capable of 20-30 point outbursts (24 vs. Tennessee, 26 vs. Drake), though he went scoreless against Mississippi State and needed 20 shots for 21 points at Oklahoma \u2014 his inconsistency is Vanderbilt's biggest wildcard. The Commodores are dramatically better at home (13-2 at Memorial Gym, which hosted back-to-back sellouts and two court-stormings) than on the road (roughly 4-9 away from Nashville), and their SEC Tournament first-round loss to a 13-seed Texas team on a neutral court is a troubling data point heading into a neutral-site event. Vanderbilt is a dangerous, unpredictable 10-seed with proven upsets on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the ability to win close, frenetic games \u2014 but their road/neutral-site struggles, second-half defensive collapses (opponents shoot 56% in second halves of conference games), and inability to sustain leads against elite defenses suggest a ceiling of the second round; a first-round upset is very much within reach, but a Sweet 16 run would require a level of road-game composure this team has rarely demonstrated.",

      "2024-11-09 - Ole Miss: 66 vs Grambling: 64\n\nOXFORD, Miss. -- \u2014 Dre Davis scored 13 points, Sean Pedulla added 12 points and four assists and No. 24 Mississippi rallied from a 12-point second half deficit to hold off Grambling State 66-64 Friday night. Ole Miss (2-0) used a 20-0 second-half run to take a 47-39 lead, but Grambling State (1-1) cut it to 64-63 on two free throws by Mikale Stevenson with 4 seconds left. Jaylen Murray was fouled and made two free throws for a 3-point lead, and the Rebels fouled to prevent the Tigers from attempting a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Murray scored 10 points for the Rebels. Stevenson scored 16 points, Kintavious Dozier had 15 points and Ernest Ross added 14 for Grambling State. The Tigers led 33-25 at halftime. Takeaways Grambling State: The unheralded Tigers have won 45 games over the past two seasons, a Southwest Athletic Conference crown and an NCAA Tournament game. The non-conference schedule is top heavy, but coach Donte\u2019 Jackson\u2019s spirited crew looks to be the team to beat in the SWAC. Mississippi: Chris Beard continued to experiment with multiple offensive and defensive combinations as 10 players got significant playing time. The Rebels have depth and scoring on the perimeter, but there is room for improvement in the rebounding category. Key moment Trailing 39-27, the Rebels went on a 20-0 run over in six minutes to build a 47-39 cushion with 11 minutes remaining. Davis had eight consecutive points to open the decisive burst. Key stat Ole Miss shot 14 of 18 from the free-throw line in the second half and forced 22 turnovers. Grambling State outrebounded the Rebels 39-33.

      "2024-11-13 - Ole Miss: 64 vs South Alabama: 54\n\nOXFORD, Miss. -- \u2014 Sean Padilla 19 of his 27 points in the first half and No. 24 Mississippi used a 9-0 surge in the final two minutes to beat South Alabama 64-54 on Tuesday night. Jaemyn Brakefield scored 14 points for Ole Miss (3-0) while Malik Dia added a game-high 13 rebounds. The Rebels led 38-26 at halftime. Judah Brown led South Alabama (1-2) with 16 points while Myles Corey added 14. The Jaguars pulled within 55-52 in the final four minutes, but consecutive 3-point shots by Jaylen Murray, Brakefield and Pedulla put the game away. The Rebels played without Matthew Murrell, a three-year starter at shooting guard, due to lower back concerns. Takeaways South Alabama: Richie Riley\u2019s Jaguars have been .500 or better for six consecutive seasons but the challenge to that streak will be blending eight transfers before Sun Belt Conference play. Ole Miss: The game was billed as a \u201cThrowback at the Tad ((Smith) Pad\". The former on-campus home court \u2013 a cozy, noisy 7,500-seat round-shaped arena. Chris Beard\u2019s squad reminded fans why the Rebels owned such a strong home court advantage in the nostalgic but outdated facility. Key moment Ole Miss snapped a 24-24 tie with a 14-2 run in the final five minutes of the first half to build a 38-26 halftime lead. Padilla opened the surge with consecutive 3-point shots and the Rebels never trailed again. Key stat The Rebels finished 13-of-38, 34%, from beyond the 3-point line, led by Pedulla at 7-of-16. The long range shooting was decisive as Ole Miss managed only 21-of-64, 32 percent, from the field. Up next South Alabama hosts Mercer on Saturday afternoon.

Mikeal Brown-Jones scored 14 points for the Rebels (4-0), while Malik Dia and Dre Davis added 11 points apiece. Matthew Murrell, a three-year starter at shooting guard for the Rebels, hit a game-opening 3-point shot after missing the previous game with a back injury and scored 10 points. Jalen Lake and Nique Clifford led Colorado State (3-1) with 21 and 18 points, respectively. The Rams trailed 45-26 at halftime but were within nine points in the second half by hitting nine 3-pointers, five by Lake. Takeaways Colorado State: Picked seventh in the preseason Mountain West Conference coaches poll, coach Niko Medved\u2019s Rams could not climb out of the early hole despite solid performances from Lake and Clifford. Ole Miss: The Rebels shot 28 of 55 (50.9%). After consecutive non-conference wins blemished by poor shooting, the unbeaten Rebels looked like an AP-ranked team, especially in the first half. Key moment Ole Miss built a 36-15 lead in the opening 13 minutes and shot 15 of 24 from the floor, including five 3-pointers from five players.

After several weeks of cold shooting in home games, Auburn (26-2, 14-1 Southeastern Conference) made 11 of 21 attempts from 3-point range. The game started with a 3 from Baker-Mazara, a game-time decision due to an undisclosed issue. Denver Jones, Miles Kelly and Chaney Johnson each had 13 points for the Tigers.

    "profile_summary": "Ole Miss enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed with a 24-12 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine toughness in one of college basketball's deepest conferences, though not without its share of vulnerabilities. Against ranked opponents, the Rebels went approximately 5-9, with marquee wins over No. 4 Alabama (74-64 on the road), No. 14 Kentucky (98-84 at home), No. 4 Tennessee (78-76 at home), No. 23 Arkansas (73-66 on the road), and No. 13 BYU (96-85 in overtime at a neutral site), while absorbing losses to No. 1 Auburn twice, No. 1 Auburn in the SEC Tournament, No. 13 Purdue (78-80 on a buzzer putback), No. 13 Texas A&M (62-63 at the buzzer), and No. 22 Missouri, among others \u2014 a pattern that reveals a team capable of beating elite opponents but prone to late-game collapses against the very best. Their final five games tell a nuanced story: a dramatic 78-76 home win over No. 4 Tennessee on Brakefield's layup with 7 seconds left, a 19-point blowout loss at No. 5 Florida, a thrilling 83-80 SEC Tournament win over Arkansas on Pedulla's buzzer three after two missed Razorback free throws, and a 62-57 quarterfinal loss to No. 1 Auburn \u2014 producing a 2-3 finish down the stretch that is neither a hot streak nor a full-blown slump, but rather a familiar Ole Miss pattern of beating good teams and struggling to sustain it against the elite. Stylistically, the Rebels are a perimeter-oriented, turnover-averse team \u2014 they led the nation in fewest turnovers per game at 8.8 \u2014 capable of explosive shooting nights (13-of-30 from three vs. Kentucky, six Murrell threes in the first half alone) but also susceptible to rebounding deficits that have burned them repeatedly; Mississippi State outrebounded them 51-29 in one meeting, Texas A&M had a 48-31 edge in another, and Auburn consistently dominated the glass, and those size mismatches are a structural weakness that tournament opponents will exploit. Sean Pedulla is the engine of this team \u2014 a clutch, high-volume guard who has delivered in multiple pressure moments including the go-ahead three vs. Oklahoma, the tournament-winner vs. Arkansas, and a 29-point performance against No. 1 Auburn \u2014 while Malik Dia has been arguably the Rebels' most complete player in SEC play, erupting for 21, 19, and 23 points in a three-game stretch against Arkansas, LSU, and Alabama respectively, and Jaemyn Brakefield has provided crucial secondary scoring and clutch buckets, including the game-winner against Tennessee. Matthew Murrell's availability has been a concern \u2014 he missed multiple games with a lower-body injury \u2014 though he has been active and productive in the tournament stretch. At home, Ole Miss was dominant for most of the season (wins over Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Auburn nearly), but road and neutral-site results are genuinely mixed: strong road wins at Arkansas and Alabama sit alongside blowout losses at Auburn and Florida and neutral-site defeats to Purdue and Missouri, suggesting the Rebels are a better team when the crowd is behind them. They carry a resilient, never-quite-broken identity \u2014 they are 5-0 in games decided by four points or fewer since late January \u2014 but that same habit of living in close games reflects an inconsistency that has cost them when the margin for error disappears. Ole Miss is a dangerous, tournament-tested 6-seed with real upset potential and the perimeter firepower to light up any opponent on a given night, but their rebounding deficiencies, road inconsistency, and 1-4 record against top-five teams this season cap their realistic ceiling at the **Sweet 16** \u2014 threatening enough to knock off a 3-seed, but likely short of the firepower and frontcourt depth needed to advance further.",

The Terrapins (18-6, 8-5) rebounded from a loss Thursday at Ohio State. Maryland has won five of six. Queen had a double-double before halftime and was the most impactful freshman on the court, and as usual Maryland got balanced scoring from its starting lineup. Rodney Rice scored 19 and Selton Miguel added 17. The Scarlet Knights jumped out to an early 14-7 lead, but the Terps dominated the rest of the first half. A 3-pointer by Rice put Maryland up 46-31, and it was 49-38 at halftime. Rutgers eventually pulled back to within three before the Terrapins pushed the lead into double digits again. Take aways Rutgers: The Scarlet Knights got Harper back from an ankle injury recently and beat No. 23 Illinois on Wednesday, but they were unable to build on that with another win \u2014 and missed a chance to add a big road victory to their resume. Maryland: Queen took advantage of Bailey's illness and dominated inside, and when the Terps shoot 3s like this, he has plenty of room to operate.

The Terps shot 58.5%, their second-best performance of the season. Juwan Gary led the Cornhuskers (16-9, 6-8) with 22 points and Brice Williams had 20 points for his fifth straight game with at least that many. The Terps swept the season series, and Queen was more of a factor than in the 69-66 win at home on Jan. 19. He scored a season-low three points in that game. Takeaways Maryland: The Terrapins have won six of seven games, improved to 3-5 on the road and play their next three at home. Nebraska: This was an extremely tough matchup for the Huskers without 6-foot-10 starting forward Berke Buyuktuncel, who was out with an ankle injury. The 6-10 Andrew Morgan started in place of Buyuktuncel and rotated with the 7-1 Braxton Meah, which often left the 6-6 Gary to guard Queen.

The Hawkeyes (14-11, 5-9 Big Ten) actually led 51-47 at halftime, but they missed all 13 of their 3-point attempts after the break and could do little to slow a rampant Maryland team. The Terrapins (20-6, 10-5) have won seven of their last eight games. Maryland's previous high score in a Big Ten game came in a 100-65 win over Ohio State in 2016. The starting five scored 95 points for Maryland. Derik Queen and Rodney Rice scored 18 points each, Selton Miguel added 17 and Julian Reese 16. Pryce Sandfort scored 15 points for Iowa, which has lost four of five. Maryland opened the second half with a 23-4 run, with Rice scoring the first eight.

The Terrapins also made their first seven shots of the first half on their way to a 58% day from the field. Take aways Iowa: The Hawkeyes are not a good defensive team, and this was a particularly ugly showing. Maryland scored early and often, and Iowa could only keep up for a half. Maryland: The Terps showed off their impressive balance, if not their depth. Maryland showed how quickly it can put a game away at home. Key moments The 23-4 run put Maryland ahead to stay, but another run of 16-1 pushed the lead to 26. Key stats The was the 3,000th game in the history of Iowa men's basketball.

The Terrapins (21-6, 11-5 Big Ten) and Trojans (14-12, 6-9) met for the first time since 1990, when each was in a different conference. Maryland never trailed, opening each half with a flourish and keeping USC at bay. Derik Queen had 13 points and 17 rebounds for the Terps. Wesley Yates III scored 21 for USC. Maryland scored the game's first 11 points and led 18-5 after a dunk by Jordan Geronimo. It was 37-27 at the half, and then the Terps began the second with a 15-5 run to double their advantage to 20. Clark Slajchert came off the bench to make three 3-pointers for the Trojans in the second half. USC cut the lead to six but got no closer. Maryland's starting five scored 85 of its 88 points. Take aways USC: The Trojans have lost four of five. They lacked Maryland's balance, with only Yates scoring more than 11 points. Maryland: It's probably too late for the Terps to win a share of the Big Ten title, but a bye to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament is in play. They'd need to finish in the top four, and this victory put them in a tie for fourth. Key moment USC coach Eric Musselman tried to slow Maryland's quick start, calling a timeout after two quick 3-pointers. But the Terps pushed the lead into double digits and the Trojans were playing catch-up the rest of the way. Key stats Maryland is 16-1 at home this season, with 13 straight wins.

      "2025-02-26 - Maryland: 55 vs Michigan State: 58\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. -- \u2014 Tre Holloman made a buzzer-beater from beyond midcourt to give No. 8 Michigan State a 58-55 win over No. 16 Maryland in a sensational finish Wednesday night. Holloman's turnover in the backcourt helped the Terrapins (21-7, 11-6 Big Ten) tie the game with 42.1 seconds remaining, and after a miss by Michigan State's Jaxon Kohler, Maryland had a chance to win it with the shot clock off. But Ja'Kobi Gillespie missed a 3-pointer, the Spartans (23-5, 14-3) rebounded and Holloman had enough time to put up a shot from a few feet behind midcourt. The buzzer sounded as the ball was airborne and Michigan State players leaped off the bench to mob Holloman after his shot swished through the net. Michigan State took a half-game lead over No. 15 Michigan atop the Big Ten. Holloman finished with nine points on 3-of-12 shooting. Jase Richardson led Michigan State with 15 points on a night both teams shot below 35%. Rodney Rice scored 20 for Maryland. The Terrapins trailed 55-48 before rallying. With Michigan State up by two, Holloman had a pass intercepted, then fouled Ja'Kobi Gillespie with 42.1 seconds remaining. Gillespie's free throws made it 55-all. Take aways Michigan State: Holloman's shot might be the key to another Big Ten title for coach Tom Izzo, and the Spartans clamped down on a Maryland starting five \u2014 known as the \u201cCrab Five\u201d \u2014 that has been outstanding of late. Maryland: Big men Derik Queen and Julian Reese had a rough night offensively, shooting a combined 4 for 18 from the field. Key moment Gillespie had a good look at the basket on his final 3, but he shot it early enough to give the Spartans time for one final heave.

Takeaways Maryland: The Terps inched closer to a top-four seed and a double bye in the conference tourney with the win.

The Terrapins (24-7, 14-6 Big Ten) had a sluggish day offensively but did enough to win for the seventh time in eight games \u2014 with the only defeat coming on a 65-foot shot at the buzzer against Michigan State late last month. Ja'Kobi Gillespie scored 17 points for the Terps, and Derik Queen added 10 points and 10 rebounds. Maryland snapped a three-game skid against Northwestern, which included an overtime loss to the Wildcats in January. Nick Martinell scored 28 points for Northwestern (16-15, 7-13), which is still headed to the Big Ten Tournament despite the loss. The Wildcats led for a good deal of the first half and were up 42-41 in the second before being outplayed down the stretch.

Donaldson finished with 12 points and nine assists, but the heavy lifting was done by Vladislav Goldin, who had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Danny Wolf Jr. with 21 points and 14 rebounds. The Wolverines (24-9) will face No. 18 Wisconsin in Sunday's championship game in Indianapolis. Donaldson's remarkable drive rekindled images of Tyus Edney in 1995 and Danny Ainge in 1981, who made similar plays to add their stories to the March Madness book. This time, Maryland tried to preserve the lead without fouling. Derik Queen finished with a career high 31 points to lead the Terrapins (25-8) who entered the game on a nine-game winning streak. Selton Miguel added 16 points. Maryland has never reached the tourney's title game. Takeaways Michigan: The tandem of Wolf and Goldin \u2014 and the heroic play by Donaldson \u2014 were good enough to carry the Wolverines in the semifinals.

    "profile_summary": "Maryland enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 4-seed with a 27-9 record and one of the most balanced offensive attacks in the country, built around what the program has dubbed the \"Crab Five\" \u2014 a starting unit that has been dominant enough to outscore opponents on its own. Against ranked opponents, the Terrapins went an impressive 8-7, with statement wins over No. 17 Illinois (91-70 on the road), No. 22 UCLA (79-61), No. 17 Wisconsin (76-68), No. 18 Rutgers (90-81), and No. 15 Michigan (71-65 in Ann Arbor), plus a pair of ranked road wins late in the season that demonstrated genuine toughness. Their losses to ranked teams \u2014 No. 15 Marquette, No. 8 Purdue, No. 9 Oregon, No. 18 Ohio State (a stunning 17-point collapse), and No. 8 Michigan State twice, including a half-court buzzer-beater at home \u2014 reveal a team that can go toe-to-toe with elites but has a troubling habit of late-game meltdowns. In the Big Ten Tournament, Maryland demolished No. 24 Illinois 88-65 with just three turnovers before falling 81-80 to Michigan on a full-court layup with 0.4 seconds remaining \u2014 a brutal but emblematic ending for a team that keeps finding new and painful ways to lose close games.\n\nFreshman center Derik Queen is the engine of this offense and has been sensational of late \u2014 posting a career-high 31 points in the Big Ten semifinal loss and averaging what amounts to a double-double threat every night, with elite footwork and free-throw drawing ability (9-for-11 shooting, 6-for-6 at the line against Nebraska). Ja'Kobi Gillespie is a steady, high-IQ transfer guard averaging around 15-18 points across the final stretch, while Rodney Rice provides explosive perimeter scoring \u2014 his 23-point, five-of-seven from three performance to win at Indiana exemplifies the kind of timely shooting this team can produce. Julian Reese is a reliable double-double big and Selton Miguel is one of the more underrated shooters in the Big Ten. The concern, however, is depth: the starting five scores the overwhelming majority of Maryland's points (85 of 88 against USC, 95 of 101 against Iowa), and when Queen and Reese go cold simultaneously \u2014 as they did shooting 4-of-18 combined against Michigan State \u2014 the offense has no reliable alternative. Location matters enormously for this team: Maryland was 16-1 at home but a pedestrian 3-5 in true road games before finishing 3-6, and their neutral-site r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is mixed, though they did win the Empire Classic over Villanova on a clutch Queen free throw. The Terrapins play a high-octane, starting-five-dependent style that can blow teams out (108-37 over Canisius, 101-75 over Iowa) but is dangerously prone to second-half shooting collapses and turnover-induced breakdowns \u2014 they were held to 25% shooting in the second half at Ohio State and committed 16 turnovers in the Northwestern overtime loss. Maryland's realistic tournament ceiling is the Elite Eight: Queen's star power and the starting unit's offensive balance make them a genuine danger to any mid-seed opponent, and their ranked-win portfolio proves they can beat good teams, but their late-game fragility, bench-scoring vacuum, and history of catastrophic collapses against elite defenses make a Final Four run a long shot without significant improvement in closing out games.",

Four days after having their 16-game winning streak in Gainesville snapped by Missouri, the Gators (16-2, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) bounced back with more effort and energy despite dealing with more turmoil. Assistant coach Taurean Green was on the bench two days after being publicly accused of sexual assault. ESPN reported Thursday that a formal complaint was filed with the school\u2019s Title IX office accusing Green of kissing an athletic department employee and trying to put his hand down her pants in March 2024. It came while the university is still investigating a Sept. 27 Title IX complaint against head coach Todd Golden that includes allegations of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and stalking, according to copies of the complaint. None of it seemed to affect Florida with Texas (12-6, 1-4) visiting the O'Connell Center for the first time since 1996. The Gators made eight 3-pointers and outrebounded the Longhorns by eight. The SEC's leading scorer, Tre Johnson, led Texas with 16 points on 6-of-15 shooting. Takeaways Texas: No SEC team has had a tougher opening conference slate than the Longhorns, with losses to three top-five teams (Auburn, Tennessee and Florida). Florida: The Gators missed nine of their first 10 shots in another lackluster start, but quickly turned it around thanks to Martin and Clayton. Key moment Florida used a 15-0 run in the first half to help build a double-digit lead that Texas never really challenged.

The Gators shot 6 of 26 in the second half. Tennessee took the lead at the end of the first half when Cade Phillips and Darlinstone Dubar had back-to-back blocks before Lanier drilled a 3-pointer. Clayton went down with a left ankle injury with 1:07 left. Takeaways Florida: Thomas Haugh, a 6-foot-9 power forward, has emerged as one of the top sixth men in the country. His contributions off the bench have been significant. \u2026 Center Micah Handlogten, who sustained a gruesome ankle injury at the SEC Tournament last year, was considering a comeback in February, but has decided to sit out the year. Tennessee: If the Vols are going to have a strong finish to the season and a deep run in the postseason, senior point guard Zeigler will need to be healthy. He injured his right knee Tuesday against Kentucky. Key moment From the end of the first half to the first few minutes of the second, Tennessee had a 14-2 run that put the Vols ahead 30-21.

Fellow guard Alijah Martin gave the Gators another scare when he tweaked his left hip in the first half. Martin returned but was hardly a factor. Richard and Condon, meanwhile, carried Florida (19-3, 6-3 Southeastern Conference). Richard hit 5 of 7 shots from 3-point range, and Condon chipped in nine rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots. Seldom-used guard Urban Klavzar also had a couple of big baskets, draining back-to-back 3s with about eight minutes to play to give Florida a nine-point advantage. He added an assist on the next play. Coach Todd Golden\u2019s team cruised from there and surely will point to this game as evidence of its depth. Jason Edwards led the Commodores (16-6, 4-5) with 20 points. Jaylen Carey added 15 points before fouling out. Takeaways Vanderbilt: The Commodores played solid defense throughout and looked as if they might pull off an upset. Ultimately, their inability to defend the 3-point line down the stretch was their undoing. Florida: Florida took a cautious approach with Clayton, especially with a road trip to top-seeded Auburn on tap Saturday.

Takeaways Alabama: The loss derailed the Crimson Tide\u2019s hope of winning the program's third SEC tournament title in the last five seasons. With 10 wins over AP Top 25 opponents this season, a program record for most in a single season, Alabama has a strong case for a good seed in the NCAA Tournament. Florida: The Gators were impressive in the defensive end, holding the high-scoring Crimson Tide to just 82 points. Entering Saturday, Alabama had scored 90 points or more in 18 games this season, the most in Division I. Key moment Richard hit a 3-pointer with 9:24 remaining in the second half to give Florida a 21-point lead and put the game out of reach for Alabama. Key stat After a tightly contested first half, Florida outscored the Crimson Tide 57-37 over the final 20 minutes. Up next Florida and Tennessee split the two-game season series, with both teams winning on their home courts. The Crimson Tide wait to learn the team's first opponent in the NCAA tourney. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and",

    "profile_summary": "Florida enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 1-seed with a dominant 36-4 record and one of the most compelling r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the country. The Gators' record against ranked opponents is exceptional \u2014 notable wins include a 73-43 dismantling of then-No. 1 Tennessee at home in January, a stunning 90-81 road victory over No. 1 Auburn in February, a 99-94 road win over No. 7 Alabama, and a 83-66 neutral-site win over Arizona State, giving Florida multiple top-10 road and neutral-site wins that few teams in the nation can match. Their only losses came against Kentucky (106-100 on the road), Missouri (83-82 at home on a late free throw), Tennessee (64-44 on the road without a healthy Walter Clayton Jr.), and Georgia (88-83 in a stunning collapse after leading by 13). In the SEC Tournament, Florida closed the season by running through Missouri (95-81), Alabama (104-82), and Tennessee (86-77) in consecutive days \u2014 a statement stretch that underlined their depth, firepower, and ability to win the big game when it matters most. Their season-long 36-4 record, combined with a 15-1 home mark, a 29-2 two-year home record, and multiple signature road wins, places them firmly in the national title conversation.\n\nStylistically, Florida is a multi-dimensional offensive juggernaut with serious defensive teeth. The Gators consistently launch double-digit 3-point attempts and connect at a high rate \u2014 they hit 16 3s against Southern Illinois, 14 against Auburn, and 14 against Mississippi State \u2014 while also dominating on the glass, routinely posting significant offensive rebounding advantages that generate devastating second-chance points. Walter Clayton Jr., who carries a school-record streak of consecutive games with a 3-pointer (now at 53), is the engine: a 33-point performance against Kentucky and 22-point outings against Alabama and Tennessee in the SEC Tournament confirm he is a true NBA-caliber closer. Alijah Martin (32 points against Southern Illinois, 26 at Kentucky), Will Richard (30 points at Georgia, 25 against Texas A&M), and Alex Condon (27 points and 10 rebounds against Alabama) give Florida four legitimate scoring options who can go off on any given night. Thomas Haugh has emerged as perhaps the country's best sixth man, providing 16-20 point bursts off the bench in critical games. The primary concern entering the tournament is frontcourt depth \u2014 Condon suffered a low ankle sprain and missed four games, Sam Alexis has also battled an ankle injury, and Micah Handlogten is still rounding into form after a gruesome leg injury. Florida has also shown a willingness to let games get closer than they should, trailing by 26 at Georgia before nearly completing a comeback and needing a Will Richard buzzer layup to survive South Carolina \u2014 but they have shown composure and resilience in nearly every pressure situation this season, rarely panicking and often overwhelming opponents with sustained runs. This is a national championship-caliber team: deep, experienced, star-driven, battle-tested against elite competition, and playing their best basketball entering March. **Florida's realistic tournament ceiling is a national championship**.",

    "profile_summary": "Norfolk State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 16-seed with a 24-11 record, earning an automatic bid after winning the MEAC Tournament on a buzzer-beater \u2014 Christian Ings' late heroics capping a 66-65 win over South Carolina State in the championship game. The Spartans' r\u00e9sum\u00e9 against quality competition is honest: they were blown out by Baylor (94-69) and lost to a No. 1 Tennessee squad (67-52), were handled by Stanford (70-63) and fell to Hofstra and Northern Kentucky during a rough mid-season stretch, going 0-5 against that group of high-major and upper-mid-major opponents. Their five losses in the final stretch of the regular season \u2014 including overtime defeats at South Carolina State and North Carolina Central \u2014 revealed a vulnerability on the road and in high-stakes moments, though they ultimately righted the ship by winning the MEAC title outright. Brian Moore Jr. is the engine of this team, posting a 33-point performance at High Point, a buzzer-beating three to beat North Carolina Central in February, and consistent 18-27 point outputs down the stretch; when he is locked in, Norfolk State's offense has real teeth. Christian Ings and Jalen Myers provide reliable secondary scoring, and the Spartans are capable of erupting offensively \u2014 posting 96, 105, and 92 points in blowout MEAC wins \u2014 but their style fluctuates wildly between high-scoring shootouts, clutch escapes, and flat, scoreless stretches, as evidenced by a nearly 7-minute scoring drought against Tennessee. Their final five games were a rollercoaster: a close overtime loss at South Carolina State, a heartbreaking overtime loss at North Carolina Central, a regular-season-ending road win at Howard to clinch a share of the MEAC title, and then consecutive tournament wins over Morgan State (58-55) and South Carolina State (66-65) \u2014 the latter on a last-second margin, suggesting a team that finds ways to win without always dominating. Norfolk State is scrappy and resilient, but not a team that imposes its will on opponents; they are better at home (strong MEAC record) and have struggled consistently on the road and against power-conference opponents. As a 16-seed, they are a likely first-round exit \u2014 Moore is a legitimate mid-major star capable of a big individual performance, but there is no credible evidence this group can sustain competitiveness against a 1-seed for 40 minutes, and their tendency to go cold offensively and surrender large runs against elite defenses is disqualifying for an upset.",

      "2024-11-05 - Kentucky: 103 vs Wright State: 62\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. -- \u2014 Otega Oweh scored 21 points, Koby Brea added 18 off the bench, and No. 23 Kentucky shot 60% to blow out Wright State 103-62 in Mark Pope's Wildcat debut on Monday night. Pope replaced John Calipari in April after the Hall of Famer left for Arkansas and revamped the roster with nine transfers. Oweh, an Oklahoma transfer, went 8 for 9 from the floor and made all three shots from deep. Brea made all four of his 3-pointers for Kentucky, which shot 11 of 24 from behind the arc. Lamont Butler shot 6 of 12 for 14 points while Amari Williams, who left Kentucky's final exhibition game with an injury, scored 12 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. Andrew Carr and Ansley Almonor each had 11 for the Wildcats. Brandon Noel had 20 points, Alex Huibregtse scored 16 and Solomon Callaghan added 15 for the Raiders, who shot just 35% from the field. Takeaways Wright State: The Raiders' only consistent offensive stretch didn't come until it strung together four consecutive baskets in the second half. Wright State had to work for opportunities against a Kentucky defense that challenged everything. Kentucky: The Wildcats were quick at both ends of the floor, attacking the glass defensively and spreading the ball around on the other end. The Wildcats owned the boards 41-32 and outscored the Raiders 56-26 in the paint and 37-21 in bench points. Key moment Pope walked into Rupp Arena to a crowd of 19,635 that was spread out around the arena he once called home. Key stat 30 \u2014 Kentucky's assists on 39 baskets.

Coach Mark Pope said on pregame radio that they got the \u201cbest possible news\u201d from tests earlier Friday. ... The Wildcats go home with their last tournament title in 2018. Alabama: The Crimson Tide are two wins from their third tournament title in five seasons under coach Nate Oats. They improved to 3-17 against Kentucky in this event and 2-6 in the quarterfinals. They also added to the program record for most wins over AP Top 25 opponents with the 11th this season. Key moment The Crimson Tide extinguished any thoughts of a comeback starting the second half on a 12-6 run to force a Kentucky timeout after Dioubate's 3 with 16:31 left. Alabama led by 30 late. Key stat Alabama had a 29-6 scoring edge off turnovers. Up next Butler has time to heal for the NCAA Tournament for Kentucky. Alabama has a chance to avenge a 99-94 loss to the Gators on March 5 on the Tide's home court. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

    "profile_summary": "Kentucky enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 3-seed with a 24-12 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine big-game capability alongside persistent inconsistency and a brutal injury toll. Against ranked opponents, the Wildcats went an impressive 9-7, with marquee wins over then-No. 6 Duke (77-72 in the Champions Classic), No. 6 Florida (106-100), No. 8 Tennessee twice (78-73 on the road and 75-64 at home), No. 7 Gonzaga (90-89 in overtime after trailing by 18), and No. 14 Mississippi State (95-90), but they were swept by No. 4 Alabama in three meetings \u2014 including a humiliating 99-70 beatdown in the SEC Tournament quarterfinals \u2014 and lost to Ohio State, Clemson, Ole Miss, Georgia, Vanderbilt, Arkansas, and Texas at various points. Their final five games tell a tale of two teams: a 95-64 demolition of LSU, a gutty 91-83 road win at No. 15 Missouri, a dramatic 85-84 SEC Tournament thriller over Oklahoma on Otega Oweh's buzzer-beating baseline jumper, and then an utterly flat 99-70 collapse against Alabama in which they were outscored 29-6 off turnovers and trailed by 30 \u2014 a performance that encapsulates the ceiling problem this program cannot fully escape. Kentucky is at its best as a three-level offensive attack: they lead the country in three-point volume (surpassing 300 made threes on the season), rank among the nation's elite in paint scoring, and can generate points in transition, but they are maddeningly inconsistent from game to game, capable of shooting 60% in a blowout one night and going ice-cold for entire halves the next. Otega Oweh is the engine \u2014 he averages 16 points per game, scored a career-high 28 at Oklahoma and followed it with 27 in the SEC Tournament opener, and has demonstrated the clutch-gene repeatedly, including a banked floater to beat Oklahoma and four free throws to seal the Duke win \u2014 but his production is volatile, having scored just 4 points against Auburn and 2 against Alabama when defenses locked in. The injury situation is a serious concern: point guard Lamont Butler, who leads the team in assists and provides critical defensive ball pressure, has missed nine games with a shoulder injury and played only eight minutes in the SEC Tournament opener before reaggravating it; second-leading scorer and premier three-point shooter Jaxson Robinson underwent wrist surgery and is done for the season, and his absence has robbed Kentucky of their most reliable secondary scorer over the final stretch. Amari Williams provides a 20-10 presence at center and is one of the most versatile frontcourt players in the SEC, but Kentucky's backcourt depth behind Oweh drops off sharply to freshmen Travis Perry and Colin Chandler when Butler is unavailable. Locationally, Kentucky is stronger at home (notably beating Florida, Tennessee, and Louisville in Lexington) but has shown the ability to win on the road and at neutral sites \u2014 their comeback win over Gonzaga in Seattle and the clutch SEC Tournament performances against Oklahoma indicate they do not wilt on big stages, even if Alabama has thoroughly solved them this year. The team carries a scrappy, resilient identity \u2014 they erased 18-point second-half deficits, won on buzzer-beaters twice, and swept Tennessee despite the injury carnage \u2014 but they are equally prone to complete defensive and turnover collapses, as the Auburn and second Alabama losses demonstrated. **Verdict**: Kentucky is a dangerous, unpredictable 3-seed with a realistic ceiling of the Elite Eight \u2014 capable of beating any team in the country on a night when Oweh is locked in, the threes are falling, and Williams dominates the paint, but too injury-compromised, turnover-prone, and inconsistently defended to be trusted as a Final Four or national title contender. If Butler is healthy, they are a genuine threat to reach the second weekend; if he is not, first-round upsets are well within the range of possibilities.",

    "profile_summary": "Troy enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 14-seed with a 23-11 record \u2014 a profile that reflects a legitimate Sun Belt Conference champion that has earned its bid but carries significant question marks against high-major competition. The Trojans went 0-3 against power conference opponents this season, suffering blowout losses to Arkansas (65-49), Oregon (82-61), and No. 15 Houston (62-42), where they were held to just 11 first-half points and shot 17% from the field. Those results reveal a team that struggles badly with elite athleticism and length \u2014 against Oregon, they shot a staggering 12% from three, missing 22 of 25 attempts, and against Houston they were simply overmatched in every phase. Within the Sun Belt, however, Troy was a legitimate force, eventually sharing the regular season title at 13-5 and winning the conference tournament outright, beating Old Dominion, James Madison (79-60), and Arkansas State (94-81) in succession in Pensacola. Their ranked wins/losses record stands at 0-1 against ranked opponents (the Houston loss), with no signature victories over quality competition to point to. The Trojans play a style centered on guard play and offensive volume \u2014 they are capable of putting up points in bunches, as evidenced by a 105-60 demolition of LaGrange and the 94-81 tournament championship win \u2014 but they are also prone to close-game vulnerability, dropping multiple one-possession games including a heartbreaker to Texas State (74-73 on a free throw with 1.1 seconds left) and late losses to South Alabama and Louisiana decided in the final seconds.\n\nHeading into the tournament, Troy is playing its best basketball of the season, winning five straight including three conference tournament games by an average margin of roughly 17 points. Tayton Conerway is the engine of this offense and is performing at an elite level: he posted 22 points in the semifinal win over James Madison, 24 points in the regular-season finale at Texas State, and has repeatedly delivered in high-leverage moments, including a 32-point effort against Arkansas State and a 20-point clutch performance in a 58-57 road escape at Marshall. Myles Rigsby provides a second reliable scoring option \u2014 he scored 25 against Southern Miss and 20 in the tournament championship \u2014 while Thomas Dowd has emerged as a versatile third weapon, putting up 18 points and 12 rebounds against James Madison. The team is notably stronger at home (where they built their Sun Belt record) and has occasionally been shaky on the road, but their neutral-site conference tournament performance \u2014 three wins, none closer than 13 points \u2014 is genuinely encouraging. The concern is that their ceiling was fully exposed by Houston and Oregon: when facing elite defensive pressure and length, this offense collapses, and there is no evidence they can sustain a performance against a high-major-caliber 3-seed opponent. Troy is a dangerous, hot, and well-coached 14-seed capable of keeping a first-round game close and possibly stealing a win if Conerway goes off \u2014 but a second-round run is a significant ask for a team that was outscored 42-11 in a half against a Power Four opponent. **Realistic tournament ceiling: First-round upset threat, likely exit in Round 1 or, at best, Round 2.**",

      "2024-11-05 - Marquette: 102 vs Stony Brook: 62\n\nMILWAUKEE -- \u2014 Kam Jones scored 32 points while shooting 14 of 16 from the floor as No. 18 Marquette breezed to a 102-62 season-opening victory over Stony Brook on Monday night. Jones was 4 of 6 from 3-point range and finished two points off his career high. Jones had 34 points in back-to-back games against DePaul and Xavier last season. Chase Ross added a career-best 23 points and David Joplin scored 13. Marquette is chasing its fourth straight NCAA Tournament berth as it attempts to replace 2024 Associated Press All-America second-team guard Tyler Kolek and Oso Ighodaro, who were both selected in the second round of the NBA draft. Joe Octave scored 12 points and Ben Wight had 10 points and eight rebounds for Stony Brook. Takeaways Stony Brook: This Coastal Athletic Association program returns only one starter from a team that went 20-15 last season. Octave, a Holy Cross transfer, should be a major player for the Seawolves. He made three 3-pointers in the first four minutes. Marquette: The Golden Eagles don't really have a pure point guard on their roster while Sean Jones recovers from a torn anterior cruciate ligament, but they distributed the ball quite well. Marquette had 22 assists with just seven turnovers. Key moment This game went back and forth until Jones hit a 3-pointer off an assist from Ben Gold with 10:35 left in the first half to put Marquette ahead 21-19. Jones' shot marked the 10th and final lead change of the night. That basket began a 9-0 run, and Marquette led comfortably the rest of the way. Key stats Marquette shot 58.8% (40 of 68) from the floor. The Golden Eagles went just 9 of 31 from 3-point range, but they made 83.8% of their shots (31 of 37) from inside the arc. Up next Stony Brook plays at Central Michigan on Thursday, while Marquette hosts George Mason on Friday. The George Mason game will take place at the Al McGuire Center on Marquette's campus rather than at the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee, which serves as the Golden Eagles' typical home court. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Jones had 24 points and eight assists for Marquette (2-0). Darius Maddox scored 20 for George Mason (1-1).

Yet they played hard all night and kept this game competitive. Marquette: Although the Golden Eagles remained unbeaten, their 3-point struggles continued.

Jones has helped fill the void and Mitchell helped against the Terrapins, but depth is an issue. Maryland: The Terrapins showed they can hang with a top-15 team, but this was a tough loss to take at home in a packed arena. Key moment Maryland led 61-59 before Jones drained a 3-pointer and followed a missed 3 by Queen with a three-point play that made it 65-61 with 6:11 remaining. Key stat Maryland committed 13 turnovers and went 9 of 14 from the foul line, including those two critical misses by Harris-Smith in the final minute.

      "2025-03-06 - UConn: 72 vs Marquette: 66\n\nSTORRS, Conn. -- \u2014 Alex Karaban scored 21 points, including a pivotal 3-pointer with 23.7 seconds left, and UConn defeated No. 20 Marquette 72-66 on Wednesday night. Liam McNeeley had 11 points and Samson Johnson added 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Huskies (21-9, 13-6 Big East), who pulled into a tie with Marquette for third place in the conference standings.

David Joplin had 23 points and Kam Jones scored 21 for the Golden Eagles (22-8, 13-6). UConn ripped off 10 straight points with dunks by Jaylin Stewart, Tarris Reed Jr. and Johnson to take a 61-54 lead with 7:49 remaining. The opening tip was delayed by 22 minutes as a result of facility issues, according to a statement from UConn. Takeaways Marquette: Unless they get some unexpected help this weekend, the Golden Eagles appear headed for a 4-5 matchup with Xavier in the quarterfinals of the Big East Tournament next week at Madison Square Garden. UConn: Karaban, Johnson and Diarra showed their experience and winning pedigree down the stretch as coach Dan Hurley's team gears up for another postseason run.

      "2025-03-08 - Marquette: 84 vs St. John's: 86\n\nMILWAUKEE -- \u2014 Zuby Ejiofor hit a tiebreaking shot at the buzzer, Kadary Richmond got the first St. John\u2019s triple-double this century and the sixth-ranked Red Storm beat No. 20 Marquette 86-84 in overtime Saturday for their sixth consecutive victory. St. John\u2019s (27-4, 18-2 Big East) matched a program record for regular-season wins. The Johnnies went 27-4 in 1985-86 and ended up finishing 31-5 that year. They already had clinched their first Big East outright regular-season title since 1985 a week earlier. After Marquette\u2019s Kam Jones converted a game-tying driving layup with 26.4 seconds left, RJ Luis Jr. missed a 3-pointer for St. John\u2019s. Marquette\u2019s Chase Ross initially got the rebound, but Richmond knocked the ball out of his hands and it went to Simeon Wilcher. Wilcher got the ball to Ejiofor, who hit a shot in the paint just before the horn sounded. Luis had 28 points and 11 rebounds, while Ejiofor had 17 points and 12 rebounds. Richmond finished with 10 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds. Richmond's triple-double was the first for St. John's since Ron Artest had 13 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists against Seton Hall on Jan. 9, 1999. Jones had 32 points and David Joplin scored 21 for Marquette (22-9, 13-7). Takeaways St. John's: The Red Storm won even without having starting guard Deivon Smith due to a shoulder issue. Marquette: The Golden Eagles enter the postseason having gone 4-6 since the start of February. Key moment Luis scored in the paint with 10.7 seconds left in regulation to force the extra session. Marquette\u2019s Ben Gold missed a potential game-winner in the closing seconds of regulation. Key stats St. John's outscored Marquette 27-10 in second-chance points. Marquette went 12 of 22 on free-throw attempts. Up next St. John's is the No. 1 seed in the Big East Tournament and faces either Providence or Butler in Thursday's quarterfinals.

      "2025-03-13 - Xavier: 87 vs Marquette: 89\n\nNEW YORK -- \u2014 Kam Jones scored 28 points to surpass 2,000 for his career and No. 25 Marquette rallied past Xavier 89-87 on Thursday in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals. After trailing by 14 early in the second half, the fifth-seeded Golden Eagles (23-9) took the lead for good at 81-80 on Jones' layup with 1:16 remaining. David Joplin connected on a pivotal 3-pointer with 26 seconds left, and Marquette held on to earn a semifinal matchup with sixth-ranked and top-seeded St. John's on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Ryan Conwell scored a career-high 38 points for Xavier (21-11), a school record for a Big East Tournament game. The fourth-seeded Musketeers, perched precariously on the bubble for an NCAA Tournament bid, had won seven straight. With former Marquette star Dwyane Wade sitting in the front row, Conwell shot 13 of 18 from the field and 7 for 11 on 3-pointers \u2014 including a long one he tossed in at the buzzer. Zach Freemantle had 15 points and Dailyn Swain added 11. Chase Ross and Stevie Mitchell scored 16 points apiece for Marquette. Joplin finished with 14. Takeaways Xavier went 11 of 23 (48%) on 3s. Should the Musketeers make the NCAA Tournament, that will be a key weapon in their arsenal. Jones boosted his career total to 2,005 points. Marquette heads into the semifinals on the strength of his scoring, but the Golden Eagles showed they're more than a one-man band with five players in double figures. Key moment Ross stole the ball from Freemantle near the top of the key, leading to a 3 from Joplin that gave Marquette an 84-80 advantage with 26 seconds to play. Key stat Jones scored in double figures for the 48th straight game, the longest current streak in the country. Up next Xavier: Fingers crossed on Selection Sunday.

      "2025-03-14 - St. John's: 79 vs Marquette: 63\n\nNEW YORK -- \u2014 Zuby Ejiofor scored a career-high 33 points, a St. John's record in the Big East Tournament, and the sixth-ranked Red Storm pulled away from No. 25 Marquette 79-63 on Friday night to reach the conference championship game for the first time in 25 years. Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis Jr. added 13 points and Ejiofor grabbed nine rebounds as the top-seeded Red Storm (29-4) wiped out an early 15-point deficit. They advanced to play No. 2 seed Creighton, a 71-62 semifinal winner over third-seeded UConn, on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Kadary Richmond had 12 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for St. John's, which has won eight straight \u2014 and 18 of 19 since the new year. In the program's second season under 72-year-old Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino, the Johnnies are one win from their fourth Big East Tournament title and first since 2000. Kam Jones had 24 points for the fifth-seeded Golden Eagles (23-10), who lost all three matchups with the Red Storm this season and fell to 1-6 against them at the Big East Tournament. Takeaways Marquette: A lack of strength down low was a problem against Ejiofor and St. John\u2019s all season, but the Golden Eagles will be happy to face someone outside the Big East when they enter the NCAA Tournament. St. John\u2019s: Making a strong bid for a No. 2 seed in the NCAAs, the Red Storm improved to 20-0 at home, including 11-0 at MSG \u2014 the program\u2019s most wins at The Garden since compiling 13 in 1958-59. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season. Key moment St. John\u2019s trailed by three early in the second half before Aaron Scott drained a 3-pointer, and a foul on Chase Ross was upgraded to a flagrant 1 following a replay review. That led to two free throws by Ejiofor at the start of a 16-3 spurt that gave the Red Storm a 10-point lead with 14 minutes left. Scott finished with 11 points. Key stat Marquette opened 5 for 10 on 3-pointers, then missed 12 straight. By the time David Joplin ended the skid with 11:42 left, the Golden Eagles had gone from up 10 to down 10 before he connected. Up next St. John\u2019s split two regular-season games with Creighton, which is 0-4 in Big East championship games. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season. Sign up here.

    "profile_summary": "Marquette enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 7-seed with a 23-11 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine Big East competitiveness but also persistent inconsistency against top-tier opposition. Against ranked opponents, the Golden Eagles went an estimated 6-10, with notable wins over #6 Purdue (76-58), #11 Wisconsin (88-74), #13 Maryland (78-74), and #22 Georgia early in the year, but absorbing losses to #6 Iowa State, #25 UConn (twice), #12 St. John's (three times), and #11 Creighton down the stretch. Their final five games paint a mixed picture: a blowout road win at Georgetown (76-61), a narrow road loss to UConn (72-66), an overtime home loss to St. John's (86-84), a gutsy Big East Tournament quarterfinal comeback win over Xavier (89-87), and then a 79-63 semifinal blowout loss to St. John's \u2014 a sequence that captures everything Marquette is: capable of thrilling resilience one night, then flat and overwhelmed the next. The Golden Eagles have gone just 4-6 since February 1st, a prolonged slump that raises serious questions about their momentum entering March. Structurally, Marquette wins through ball pressure and transition \u2014 they lead the Big East in steals, with Stevie Mitchell, Chase Ross, and Kam Jones all among the conference's top thieves \u2014 and when their defense generates turnovers (they forced 24 against Seton Hall, 22 against Providence), they are capable of dominant, wire-to-wire performances. However, their three-point shooting has been a chronic liability; they shot just 13.6% from deep against UConn in the regular-season finale and have hovered around 27-28% from beyond the arc over their last several games, making them dangerously one-dimensional when their interior paint advantage is neutralized. Kam Jones is the unquestioned engine \u2014 he has scored in double figures in 48 consecutive games, recorded a triple-double against Purdue, posted 32 points against St. John's in their overtime loss, and surpassed 2,000 career points in the Big East Tournament \u2014 but he has also gone cold at critical moments (6-for-21 against Iowa State, 5-for-13 against Xavier in the regular season), and the Golden Eagles lack a true playmaking point guard. The supporting cast of David Joplin, Chase Ross, and Mitchell provides enough secondary scoring to make Marquette dangerous on any given night, but their size disadvantage \u2014 exposed repeatedly by St. John's Zuby Ejiofor and UConn's Samson Johnson \u2014 is a structural problem that could doom them against long, athletic tournament opponents. Marquette is notably better at home (where they've been dominant) and more vulnerable on the road and at neutral sites against elite competition, though their comeback win over Xavier at Madison Square Garden shows they can rise to the moment. This is a team that carries real resilience and star power in Jones, but too much inconsistency, three-point volatility, and a soft underbelly against physical frontcourts to project deep. **Realistic ceiling: Round of 32 to Sweet 16** \u2014 dangerous enough to knock off a quality opponent in the first round, but too streaky and structurally flawed to advance past an elite eight-caliber program.",

    "profile_summary": "New Mexico enters the 2025 NCAA tournament as a 10-seed with a 27-8 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on Mountain West Conference dominance that belies a seeding that may undervalue them. The Lobos won the MWC regular season title outright at 17-3 and demonstrated legitimate big-game credibility early, knocking off then-No. 22 UCLA 72-64 in a neutral-site game in November, scoring 21 points off 21 Bruin turnovers in the process. Against ranked opponents, New Mexico went approximately 1-2, with that UCLA win as the signature victory and losses to No. 22 St. John's (85-71 at Madison Square Garden, where they were outrebounded 49-32) and implicitly to other quality competition \u2014 a mixed but not discouraging record against elite company. Their final five games tell a complicated story: wins over Air Force (92-71), Nevada (71-67 on the road to clinch the MWC title), and UNLV (81-67) were bracketed by a road loss at San Diego State (73-65) and a stunning semifinal upset loss to No. 5 seed Boise State (72-69) in the MWC Tournament \u2014 the same Boise State squad that had already beaten them 86-78 in February, suggesting a genuine matchup problem against the Broncos specifically rather than a systemic collapse. Entering the tournament, New Mexico is best described as a team with a defined identity and recurring vulnerabilities: they are capable of dominant wire-to-wire performances \u2014 blowing out Fresno State twice, Air Force twice, and Colorado State by 22 \u2014 but they also carry a troubling tendency to surrender large leads, as seen in the Arizona State loss (blew a 19-3 run advantage) and the Boise State MWC semifinal (trailed by nine at halftime after leading by six at the break). The engine of this team is unambiguously Donovan Dent, who posted 40 points against VCU, 34 against UNLV, 33 in the Nevada road clincher, and 30 against Arizona State \u2014 a legitimate alpha scorer who also distributes at an elite level, recording 11 assists against Nevada and consistently threading the needle as a playmaker; when Dent is locked in, New Mexico's offense operates at a genuinely high ceiling. Nelly Junior Joseph is a force in the frontcourt, delivering his 50th career double-double against Nevada and posting 19 points and 16 rebounds in the regular-season finale against UNLV, while Mustapha Amzil provides a volatile but sometimes brilliant third scoring option (career-high 28 against Arizona State, 40-point combined effort with Dent that night). New Mexico plays noticeably better at home \u2014 14-1 in Mountain West play at The Pit \u2014 and while their neutral-site record includes that impressive UCLA win, road games at Boise State and San Diego State exposed defensive breakdowns and an inability to maintain leads when opponents heat up. The team carries a resilient, competitive energy \u2014 comeback wins over Nevada (overtime, buzzer-beater by Joseph), Utah State (twice), and UNLV on the road all demonstrate composure in close games \u2014 but Boise State's ability to beat them twice, including in a game where the Lobos led at halftime, raises legitimate questions about their capacity to compete when opponents execute sustained offensive pressure for 40 minutes. As a 10-seed, New Mexico is a genuine upset threat in the first round and a team that could absolutely advance to the Sweet 16 \u2014 Dent is good enough to carry them past most mid-major or bubble opponents, and Joseph gives them a frontcourt weapon few teams at this seed can match \u2014 but their pattern of late-game defensive lapses, their 0-2 record against Boise State (suggesting vulnerability to physical, well-coached opponents), and their failure to win the MWC Tournament all cap their realistic ceiling at the Sweet 16, with a more likely outcome of a second-round exit against a power-conference opponent equipped to exploit their defensive inconsistencies.",

      "2024-11-05 - Arizona: 93 vs Canisius: 64\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. -- \u2014 Caleb Love had 17 points and six assists, Jaden Bradley added 15 points and No. 10 Arizona opened coach Tommy Lloyd's fourth season with a 93-64 win over Canisius on Monday night. Arizona jumped on the Golden Griffins from the start, scoring the first 13 points during an opening 20-2 run on its way to a 52-30 halftime lead. The Wildcats never let the lead get under 18 after that early burst to win their 18th straight home opener. Arizona dominated inside, outscoring Canisius 48-12 in the paint while grabbing 18 more rebounds. KJ Lewis added 14 points for the Wildcats, who had 20 assists and nine turnovers \u2014 five before the starters came out. The Golden Griffins needed four minutes to score their first points and had trouble with Arizona's size all night, but still shot a respectable 43% from the floor in one of college basketball's toughest road environments. Paul McMillan IV led Canisius with 20 points. Takeaways Canisius: The Golden Griffins had some good moments, particularly on offense after the slow start, but dug themselves way too big an early hole to prevent getting blown out. Arizona: The Wildcats did what they're supposed to against an overmatched nonconference opponent at home and showed off the depth that has them eyeing a deep NCAA Tournament run. Key moment Love's return after testing the NBA waters was a huge boost to the Wildcats and earned him preseason All-America honors. He asserted himself right out of the gate, scoring seven points during Arizona's big opening run. Key stat Arizona had a massive size advantage with two 7-footers in its rotation and took advantage on the glass. The Wildcats grabbed 17 offensive rebounds, scoring 19 second-chance points. Up next Canisius hosts St. Bonaventure on Saturday. Arizona hosts Old Dominion on Saturday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.

Against ranked opponents, Arizona went an estimated 8-10, with notable wins over #3 Iowa State (86-75, including Caleb Love's legendary half-court buzzer-beater to force overtime), #21 West Virginia (75-56), #16 Cincinnati (72-67), #13 Texas Tech (82-73 in a rematch after an earlier blowout loss), and #9 Texas Tech again in the Big 12 semis (86-80). However, losses to Houston twice, Iowa State on the road, Kansas State, Wisconsin, Duke, Oklahoma, and BYU underscore a team that can be beaten by quality competition on any given night. Entering the tournament, Arizona has been decidedly inconsistent over its final five games: a dominant 113-100 win over rival Arizona State, a 76-83 road loss at Kansas in the regular season finale, then a Big 12 Tournament run that included wins over Kansas (88-77) and Texas Tech (86-80) before a 64-72 loss to Houston in the championship \u2014 a 3-2 stretch that is neither a hot streak nor a genuine slump, but a reminder that this team is capable of winning three straight against quality opponents while still falling short against the nation's elite.\n\nStylistically, Arizona is an up-tempo, high-scoring team that wins through offensive firepower, depth, and size \u2014 not defensive grinds. The Wildcats have scored over 80 points in the vast majority of their wins and can get hot from three (Love's six 3s against Utah, Dell'Orso's six against Colorado), dominate the paint with a pair of 7-footers in Tobe Awaka and Henri Veesaar, and pile up assists (28 in the TCU opener). The identity of this team runs almost entirely through preseason AP All-American Caleb Love, who is wildly streaky but capable of transcendent performances \u2014 his 33-point, five-3-pointer explosion against TCU, his 27-point games against Oklahoma State and Arizona State, and his miraculous halfcourt buzzer-beater to beat Iowa State show what a top-5 talent he can be; conversely, his 2-of-13 night against Wisconsin, 3-of-13 against Duke, and continued 3-point struggles in losses to Houston and Iowa State show how badly this offense can stall when he is cold. Jaden Bradley (21 points in the regular-season finale at Kansas), KJ Lewis (career-high 21 against West Virginia), and the emerging Henri Veesaar (19 points in the Big 12 quarterfinal win over Kansas) give Arizona legitimate secondary contributors, and Carter Bryant provides defensive energy and rebounding off the bench. Notably, Trey Townsend \u2014 a starter for the first 22 games \u2014 missed time with a concussion in February, a development worth monitoring for tournament availability and rotation continuity. Arizona is clearly a stronger home team (50-4 at McKale over three-plus seasons under Lloyd) and has been vulnerable on the road, though a 6-3 true road record and a productive neutral-site showing in the Big 12 Tournament suggest they are not a team that collapses away from home either. The Wildcats carry an energy that oscillates between resilient and error-prone \u2014 they can overcome deficits (erasing a 13-point hole vs. Iowa State), but they also cough up leads (blowing a 17-point advantage vs. UCF, allowing 17-2 closing runs at Texas Tech, losing a late lead to BYU at home) and commit costly turnovers (11 in the Houston loss, 14 against BYU). Arizona's tournament ceiling is a legitimate Elite Eight, with a puncher's chance at the Final Four: the combination of Love's star power, interior size, offensive versatility, and big-game wins against top-3 Iowa State and the Big 12 regular-season champion Texas Tech proves this team can beat anybody on a given night \u2014 but the chronic 3-point volatility, Love's hot-and-cold nature, and an inability to solve Houston in two tries suggest",

Against genuinely elite competition, the Zips struggled \u2014 early-season losses to Saint Mary's (87-68), Milwaukee (100-81), and Yale (74-58) exposed real vulnerabilities against high-major and quality mid-major opponents, and a gut-punch 76-75 loss at Princeton, where they blew a 15-point lead on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer, raised legitimate questions about their composure in tight moments. Their only meaningful non-conference win came in a comfortable home victory over Northern Kentucky. That said, the Zips are playing their best basketball heading into March: their final five games saw wins over Ball State (87-82), Kent State (77-72), Toledo (96-87), Buffalo (88-70), and three MAC Tournament victories \u2014 capped by a grinding 76-74 win over Miami (OH) in the championship \u2014 demonstrating they can close out games when it matters most, though several of those wins came against mid-to-lower-tier MAC competition. The MAC Tournament title run, including a 100-90 semifinal win over Toledo, confirms they can win on consecutive days under pressure.\n\nAkron's style is best described as high-octane offense with a multi-headed scoring attack rather than a defensive juggernaut \u2014 they regularly crack 80, 90, and even 100 points, but they can also surrender big numbers, as Milwaukee's 100-point outburst and Toledo's 87 in the regular-season finale illustrate. The engine of this team is the Johnson duo: **Nate Johnson** and **Tavari Johnson** are both capable of explosive performances, with Nate dropping 28 on Toledo and Tavari erupting for 27 against Northern Kentucky earlier in the year, while **Shammah Scott** has emerged as a critical bench contributor averaging double-digit points in major moments, including 16 off the bench in the MAC title run. **Isaiah Gray** provides versatile two-way play and **Amani Lyles** offers a reliable interior presence with efficient shooting. Home-court has clearly been a comfort zone \u2014 Akron dominated at InfoCision Stadium all conference season \u2014 but their road and neutral-site record is mixed, with blowout losses at Saint Mary's and Milwaukee and a near-upset loss at Princeton on the road raising flags about their ability to win away from home. Their energy reads as confident and free-flowing when shots are falling, but they are susceptible to momentum swings and have shown a tendency to dig themselves early halftime deficits, needing second-half rallies to close out wins. As a 13-seed, Akron is genuinely dangerous for a bubble 4-seed \u2014 their offensive firepower and MAC championship pedigree make them a credible first-round upset threat \u2014 but their soft non-conference r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and demonstrated inability to compete with high-major opponents caps their realistic ceiling at the **second round**. A Sweet 16 run would require back-to-back upsets against competition they have shown no ability to handle this season, making it an unlikely but not impossible outcome.",

    "profile_summary": "UConn enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as an 8-seed with a 24-11 record \u2014 a mark that feels both disappointing and deceptive for a two-time defending national champion. The Huskies went 5-7 against ranked opponents this season, with notable wins over #8 Gonzaga (77-71 at Madison Square Garden), #15 Baylor (76-72), #9 Marquette (77-69 on the road), #24 Creighton (70-66 on the road), and #20 Marquette again (72-66 at home), while suffering losses to #12 St. John's twice, #24 Creighton at home, #9 Marquette (early season), and ranked Villanova. Their five final games tell a story of a team trending upward but with a ceiling: wins over Georgetown (93-79), Providence (75-63), and Marquette (72-66) showed real offensive firepower and rebounding dominance, but a blowout semifinal loss to Creighton (71-62) in the Big East Tournament \u2014 in which Creighton ran off 11 straight points late in the first half and never looked back \u2014 raises legitimate questions about UConn's ability to sustain momentum against elite competition over consecutive tournament days. The engine of this team is Alex Karaban, the only returning starter from the back-to-back championship rosters, who consistently delivers in big moments \u2014 his 21-point, 11-rebound performance at Texas, his clutch 3-pointers against Marquette and Butler, and 18 points in the Big East quarterfinal win over Villanova all speak to his reliability. Freshman Liam McNeeley missed eight games with a high ankle sprain before exploding for a season-high 38 points and 10 rebounds at Creighton upon his return, giving UConn a genuine second star when healthy. Solo Ball has emerged as a streaky but dangerous three-point shooter \u2014 his 7-of-9 performance from deep against Marquette and career-high 25 points demonstrated an elite ceiling \u2014 while Tarris Reed Jr. provides relentless interior production off the bench, including a 24-point, 18-rebound, six-block performance at Providence. The Huskies play best when they are a patient, inside-out team that dominates the paint, forces turnovers, and gets to the foul line; their worst losses \u2014 all three Maui Invitational defeats to Memphis, Colorado, and Dayton \u2014 came when opponents shot well from three and UConn struggled to defend the perimeter, a vulnerability that has never fully been corrected. Home-court UConn went 14-4 in Storrs and Hartford, including a 28-game home winning streak snapped by Creighton in January, while road and neutral-site play produced several painful collapses: the overtime loss to Seton Hall (a team that finished 8-18), the buzzer-beater loss at Colorado in Maui, and the Big East semifinal loss all point to a team that can be rattled when the game tightens late against sharp opponents. Dan Hurley's Huskies carry the pedigree, experience, and roster depth of a team capable of making a run \u2014 Karaban, Reed, Diarra, Ball, and McNeeley give them five legitimate contributors \u2014 but their inconsistency against top competition, persistent turnover problems (19 in one game alone, 25 in another), and susceptibility to late-game collapses against inferior opponents make a deep run feel more like a gamble than a guarantee. Their realistic ceiling is the Sweet 16: dangerous enough as an 8-seed to pull an upset in round one, with enough star power and tournament DNA to win a second game, but too prone to the kind of defensive breakdowns and late-game mistakes that elite tournament teams will punish.",

The Sooners opened the year a stunning 13-0, winning the Battle 4 Atlantis with victories over then-No. 24 Arizona and Louisville, and climbing as high as No. 12 in the AP Poll, before SEC play exposed real structural limitations. Against ranked opponents across the full season, Oklahoma went roughly 6-13: legitimate statement wins over Arizona, Michigan (87-86 on a Jeremiah Fears buzzer-beating four-point play), Louisville, Vanderbilt, Mississippi State, and Missouri bookend a brutal stretch of blowout losses to Alabama (107-79), Auburn (98-70), Tennessee (70-52), Florida (85-63), and Missouri (82-58), among others. Their final five games capture their maddening inconsistency \u2014 a gut-punch 83-82 loss to Kentucky on a banked Otega Oweh floater, an 87-84 loss at Ole Miss on a last-possession turnover, a career-high 31-point Fears explosion in a 96-84 win over No. 15 Missouri, a regular-season-closing road win at Texas, and then an SEC Tournament run of one win (81-75 over Georgia) followed by another Oweh-delivered heartbreak (85-84) \u2014 competitive to the end but unable to close.

Jalon Moore provides valuable secondary scoring and has stepped up in several big spots, including a 29-point career night against Texas, but the Sooners' depth is paper-thin and their rebounding against elite frontcourts has been catastrophically bad \u2014 outrebounded 51-26 by Alabama, 47-19 by Texas A&M, and routinely victimized by second-chance points. Positionally, Oklahoma plays noticeably better at home and on neutral sites; their neutral-court Battle 4 Atlantis run was dominant, and they covered themselves in both SEC Tournament games, but they went 1-7 in true road SEC games, a disqualifying trend against any elite opponent. This is a scrappy, Fears-dependent team that is capable of beating anyone on a given night \u2014 as their five wins over ranked opponents prove \u2014 but one that gets blown out by dominant frontcourts, turns the ball over at damaging rates, and has repeatedly lost winnable games in the final seconds due to mental lapses. Their realistic tournament ceiling is the Round of 32: Fears gives them enough shot-creation to upset a 8-seed or even make noise against a higher seed in the second round, but a matchup against an elite, frontcourt-driven team will end their run quickly.",

Despite 7-foot-1 center Ivisic playing through an ankle injury suffered during a loss at Rutgers on Thursday, they were closer to full strength \u2014 and it showed. The nation's leading rebounding team had a 50-26 advantage in points in the paint.

Isaiah Evans paced the Blue Devils (24-3) with 17 points in 18 minutes off the bench, and Kon Knueppel added 15. Duke built a 23-point lead in the first half and scored its most points since a 113-49 win over Stetson in December 2018. Flagg, the freshman star expected to be the top pick in this year's NBA draft, added seven rebounds and five assists in 23 1/2 minutes. But the Blue Devils didn't even need his best while rolling to their largest victory at MSG. Tre White had 16 points for Illinois (17-11) in a nonconference matchup between programs that reached the Elite Eight last year. Kasparas Jakucionis scored 14. Takeaways Illinois: Hampered recently by illnesses and an injury to forward Morez Johnson Jr., the Fighting Illini have faded following a 12-3 start. They've lost three straight \u2014 by an average of 26 points to teams ranked in the top 11 at the time. Duke: Eyeing a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the Blue Devils boast one of the nation's stingiest defenses.

Key moment After getting whistled for two fouls in the first 11:18 of a quiet first half, Flagg opened the second period with a fast-break dunk.

    "profile_summary": "Illinois enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed with a 22-13 record \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine talent undermined by persistent inconsistency and a brutal late-season schedule. Against ranked opponents, the Illini went 7-11: notable wins include a dominant 109-77 blowout at #9 Oregon, a come-from-behind 90-77 victory over #19 Arkansas, a clutch 80-77 Braggin' Rights win over Missouri, an 88-80 home rally past #18 Purdue, and a regular-season-closing 93-73 rout at #15 Michigan \u2014 but losses to Duke (110-67, the worst loss in program history), Michigan State twice, Wisconsin, Maryland twice, and Nebraska in overtime reveal a team that crumbles against elite competition, especially away from Champaign. Their final five games tell a story of dramatic swings: a 95-74 blowout loss at Wisconsin, a 110-67 humiliation against #3 Duke in New York, followed by three straight wins over Iowa (81-61), #15 Michigan (93-73), and #18 Purdue (88-80) in the regular season, before the Big Ten Tournament delivered a 106-94 win over Iowa and then a 88-65 dismantling at the hands of #11 Maryland \u2014 a sequence that perfectly encapsulates this team's identity: capable of looking like a top-15 program one game and collapsing catastrophically the next. Illinois plays a high-volume, high-scoring style averaging 85 points per game, ranking among the nation's leaders, and wins at their best through dominant rebounding \u2014 entering as the nation's top rebounding team with a plus-9.7 margin \u2014 and perimeter volume shooting, going deep from three at an aggressive rate even when cold, which is alarmingly often; they shot 2-of-26 from three against Duke and have failed to top 30% from distance in multiple consecutive stretches. Freshman Kasparas Jakucionis is the engine, a legitimate NBA lottery prospect who has delivered multiple 20-plus-point performances and clutch buckets \u2014 his go-ahead turnaround jumper to beat Missouri and his tiebreaking layup at Washington being prime examples \u2014 but he has also been neutralized by foul trouble at Michigan State (3 points, 9 minutes) and is far from automatic. Will Riley has emerged as a dangerous second option, scoring 22 points in the Purdue comeback and going for 27 at Minnesota; Tre White brings veteran reliability with multiple 20-point, double-digit rebound performances; Kylan Boswell provides playmaking and clutch free-throw shooting; and 7-foot-1 Tomislav Ivisic, when healthy, is a force \u2014 posting multiple double-doubles and shooting 6-of-9 from three against Arkansas \u2014 but he missed three games with mononucleosis and has played through an ankle injury and illness in recent weeks, making his health the most critical variable entering March. The Illini also lack big-game composure as a unit: they committed 17 turnovers in the Big Ten Tournament loss to Maryland (leading to a 22-0 edge in points off turnovers), coughed up 11 turnovers in the overtime loss to Northwestern, and repeatedly self-destructed in first halves against elite opponents, falling behind 36-19 against Alabama and 29-10 against Maryland in the Big Ten Tournament. At home, Illinois is dominant and difficult to beat; on the road and at neutral sites, they are a coin flip \u2014 the Oregon blowout and Michigan rout stand as elite road performances, but the Rutgers loss, Nebraska overtime loss, and the MSG catastrophe against Duke reveal a team that can completely unravel without the State Farm Center crowd behind them. Illinois carries the energy of a resilient but fragile team: they fight back \u2014 erasing 11-point deficits against Ohio State and 17-point leads blown at Washington \u2014 but they are just as capable of going flat for an entire half and never recovering, as Maryland demonstrated twice. **The realistic ceiling for this Illinois team is the Sweet 16**: Jakucionis, Riley, and the rebounding machine give them the tools to knock off a 3-seed on the right night, but their chronic three-point misfires, turnover issues, injury concerns around Ivisic, and catastrophic performances against genuinely elite opponents make a run to the Elite Eight or beyond a significant stretch.",

      "2025-02-05 - UCLA: 63 vs Michigan State: 61\n\nLOS ANGELES -- \u2014 Eric Dailey Jr. scored the go-ahead basket over two defenders with 7 seconds left, lifting UCLA to a hard-fought 63-61 victory against No. 9 Michigan State on Tuesday night. Skyy Clark scored 14 points and Tyler Bilodeau added 13 for the Bruins (17-6, 8-4 Big Ten), who won their sixth in a row and fifth against a ranked team. Jaden Akins' potential game-winning 3-pointer bounced off the front of the rim as time expired and he bent over in agony. Hall of Famer and Michigan State alum Magic Johnson was on his feet for the final seconds. Akins led the Spartans (18-4, 9-2) with 15 points, their only double-figure scorer. The game was tied three times in the final seven minutes after the Bruins blew an 11-point lead in front of alum and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Tied 61-61, Jaxon Kohler missed in the lane, grabbed his offensive rebound and got called for traveling with 23 seconds left. Takeaways Michigan State: The Spartans got swept in their LA visit, having lost 70-64 at USC to end their 13-game winning streak. Once again, they struggled offensively and their 3-point shooting continues to be spotty. UCLA: The Bruins improved to 6-1 in games decided by five points or less. They improved to 12-1 at home. Key moment UCLA's Lazar Stefanovic hit a 3-pointer for a 61-59 lead before Kohler tied it. Bilodeau and Aday Mara both missed, but the Spartans turned the ball over on a shot-clock violation with 1:13 left.

Oregon's Jackson Shelstad scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half, helping his team lead 50-36 at halftime, but didn't get much help. Kwame Evans was the only other Ducks player in double figures, scoring 10 points. Takeaways Oregon: The Ducks showed their potential in the first half, looking like the team that won its first nine games and started 13-1 with wins against Alabama and Texas A&M, before playing like a slumping squad. Michigan State: Richardson made the most of his first opportunity to start, filling in for Jeremy Fears, who was out with an illness. He approached the Michigan State freshman record set by Miles Bridges in 2017 (33 points). Key moment Richardson made back-to-back 3-pointers in the first half. Key stat Richardson was 9 of 13 in an efficient performance. Up next Michigan State hosts Indiana and Oregon hosts Northwestern on Tuesday night.

The Hoosiers (15-10, 6-8 Big Ten) had lost five straight under coach Mike Woodson, who is stepping down after the season.

Indiana's Oumar Ballo scored 14 points and Luke Goode had 10. Takeaways Indiana: The preseason pick to finish second in the Big Ten that was ranked as high as No. 14 in the AP Top 25 in late November showed some of its potential, coming back from a double-digit deficit early in the game to lead at halftime and for the entire second half. Michigan State: Interior defense was a problem, leading to giving up 38 points in the paint. It didn't help that Jaxon Kohler was called for a third foul early in the second half and was limited to 18 minutes against a team with multiple low-post options offensively. Key moment Mackenzie Mgbako made two free throws with 9.4 seconds left, putting the Hoosiers ahead by three points.

Takeaways Michigan State: Three-point shooting has been a problem for the Spartans all season. They were 14 of 60 for 23% from distance in three recent losses. They hardly bothered shooting 3s against Illinois, going 5 of 12, and won the game by taking the ball inside, scoring 40 points in the paint. Illinois: The Illini close the regular season by playing five ranked teams \u2014 including Saturday's game against Michigan State \u2014 in their last six games. They\u2019ll need to play two good halves to survive the stretch. Key moment Illinois led the entire first half and by as many as 16 points.

Michigan State's Coen Carr and Jaden Akins each scored 10 points. The Boilermakers led by seven midway through the first half and the Spartans went on a surge to take a 33-31 lead at halftime. Michigan State stayed in control in the second half and sealed the win by finishing 4 for 4 from the field. Takeaways Purdue: Without 7-foot-4 Zach Edey, now a rookie with the Memphis Grizzlies, the Boilermakers can't protect the rim and the Spartans took advantage with lobs and dunks. Michigan State: No one picked coach Tom Izzo's team to win the Big Ten title before the season started, but the balanced and streaky squad has a shot with two games left against Michigan and a home game against No. 11 Wisconsin. Key moment Coen Carr defied gravity with a dunk off a high lob to tie the score late in the first half during a 16-5 run that gave the Spartans control.

Michigan State was 9 of 22 on 3-pointers, connecting on shots beyond the arc more than usual. Takeaways Michigan State: Tom Izzo's team has put itself in a position to win a Big Ten title that wasn't expected to be in reach when the season began. The Spartans have games remaining against conference contenders: No. 11 Wisconsin, No. 20 Maryland and Michigan at home on March 9 in the regular-season finale.

      "2025-02-26 - Maryland: 55 vs Michigan State: 58\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. -- \u2014 Tre Holloman made a buzzer-beater from beyond midcourt to give No. 8 Michigan State a 58-55 win over No. 16 Maryland in a sensational finish Wednesday night. Holloman's turnover in the backcourt helped the Terrapins (21-7, 11-6 Big Ten) tie the game with 42.1 seconds remaining, and after a miss by Michigan State's Jaxon Kohler, Maryland had a chance to win it with the shot clock off. But Ja'Kobi Gillespie missed a 3-pointer, the Spartans (23-5, 14-3) rebounded and Holloman had enough time to put up a shot from a few feet behind midcourt. The buzzer sounded as the ball was airborne and Michigan State players leaped off the bench to mob Holloman after his shot swished through the net. Michigan State took a half-game lead over No. 15 Michigan atop the Big Ten. Holloman finished with nine points on 3-of-12 shooting. Jase Richardson led Michigan State with 15 points on a night both teams shot below 35%. Rodney Rice scored 20 for Maryland. The Terrapins trailed 55-48 before rallying. With Michigan State up by two, Holloman had a pass intercepted, then fouled Ja'Kobi Gillespie with 42.1 seconds remaining. Gillespie's free throws made it 55-all. Take aways Michigan State: Holloman's shot might be the key to another Big Ten title for coach Tom Izzo, and the Spartans clamped down on a Maryland starting five \u2014 known as the \u201cCrab Five\u201d \u2014 that has been outstanding of late. Maryland: Big men Derik Queen and Julian Reese had a rough night offensively, shooting a combined 4 for 18 from the field. Key moment Gillespie had a good look at the basket on his final 3, but he shot it early enough to give the Spartans time for one final heave.

Wisconsin's John Blackwell had 19 points and John Tonje scored 11 in a starting lineup that was without injured guard Max Klesmit. The Badgers led by nine points early in the game and were ahead 34-32 at halftime. Richardson's all-around game helped the Spartans take control early in the second half. Takeaways Wisconsin: Tonje was 3 of 13 and was held to 11 points in the second half, keeping the Big Ten Player of the Year candidate well below his scoring average of 19.5 points.

Iowa: The Hawkeyes had control for most of the game, but this one went like so many others this season.

With 37.2 seconds left, the rivals pushed and shoved one another at center court, where the Wolverines players were standing near the spot where Spartans seniors have kissed the logo before walking off the court in their final home game at Breslin Center since 1995. The Spartans (26-5, 17-3 Big Ten) closed the regular season with seven straight wins, including five against AP Top 25 teams. Michigan State won the Big Ten's first basketball title with 18 teams by three games over the Wolverines and No. 13 Maryland.

Takeaways Oregon: The Ducks certainly made a case for improving their NCAA Tournament seed with two solid showings in Indianapolis. Though they didn't reach the semifinals, they played well enough for 25 minutes Friday to help their cause. Michigan State: Coach Tom Izzo's team is playing like a Final Four contender. Can the Spartans get a No. 1 seed? That may be too much to ask since they'd need substantial help this weekend, but sweeping the Big Ten titles would help.

The Badgers were pushed to the very end, but they used four straight points to make it 72-67 with 1:10 to play.

    "profile_summary": "Michigan State enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 2-seed with an impressive 30-7 record, having won the outright Big Ten regular-season title \u2014 their first conference championship since 2020 \u2014 by three full games in an 18-team league. Against ranked opponents, the Spartans went an estimated 10-6, with marquee wins over No. 12 North Carolina (94-91 OT at Maui), No. 19 Illinois (80-78), No. 13 Purdue (75-66), No. 12 Michigan (75-62 on the road), No. 16 Maryland (58-55 on a Holloman buzzer-beater from beyond midcourt), and No. 11 Wisconsin (71-62), while losses came against No. 1 Kansas (77-69 at a neutral site), Memphis (71-63 at Maui), USC (70-64 on the road), UCLA (63-61 on the road), and Indiana (71-67 at home) \u2014 a loss/win profile that reveals a team fully capable of beating elite competition but genuinely vulnerable when taken out of its comfort zone, particularly on the road in California where they were swept. Their five final games tell a story of a team that peaked at the right time: a 91-84 comeback win at Iowa (trailing 58-48 before a 19-2 run), a dominant 79-62 home victory over No. 17 Michigan in the regular-season finale, a 74-64 quarterfinal win over No. 23 Oregon in the Big Ten Tournament, and then a narrow 77-74 semifinal loss to No. 18 Wisconsin \u2014 a defeat that snapped an eight-game winning streak but came on a disputed late foul call with Jeremy Fears Jr. nearly tying the game at the buzzer. That loss is a mild concern but not a red flag; the Spartans had already clinched their seed and may benefit from the rest.\n\nTom Izzo's team wins in a distinctly balanced, paint-dominant style \u2014 they score 40+ points in the paint regularly, get to the free-throw line consistently, and compensate for chronically poor 3-point shooting (hovering around 20-35% depending on the night) by pounding the interior and converting turnovers into points. Their 3-point shooting remains a genuine liability and a tournament wild card; in a loss to Kansas, they shot 3-of-24 from deep, and against Indiana they were 4-of-23. What makes this team dangerous despite that weakness is extraordinary depth \u2014 seven players averaging seven or more points, and a bench that routinely outscores opponents' reserves (23-0 bench points against Maryland, 31-13 against Michigan). Key players include senior Jaden Akins as the leading scorer, freshman Jase Richardson who has exploded down the stretch (29 points against Oregon, 22 at Iowa, 21 against Michigan in the rivalry game), Tre Holloman as a composed floor general and clutch performer (midcourt buzzer-beater at Maryland, career-high 20 in the finale), Jaxon Kohler as a reliable double-double big, and Coen Carr as an energy spark who can ignite runs with thunderous lobs and dunks. The Spartans are 12-0 since Holloman moved into the starting lineup \u2014 a telling stat that underscores how much his presence stabilizes this roster. Attitude-wise, this team is scrappy and resilient rather than dominant wire-to-wire; they trailed Oregon by 14 at halftime and still won, erased a 10-point Iowa deficit late, and survived near-collapses against Illinois and Maryland \u2014 though they have also gone flat in stretches and surrendered big first-half runs. They are unquestionably better at home (17-3 in the Breslin Center environment) and notably shaky on the road (losses at USC, UCLA, and several competitive road games decided in the final minutes), but their neutral-site Big Ten Tournament performance \u2014 back-to-back wins before losing a one-possession game to Wisconsin \u2014 suggests they can compete in March's neutral settings. With elite coaching from Hall of Famer Tom Izzo (eight prior Final Fours), tournament-hardened depth, a resilient identity, and a proven ability to beat top-25 teams, Michigan State's realistic ceiling is the **Elite Eight**, with legitimate Final Four upside if Richardson continues his late-season ascent and the 3-point",

    "profile_summary": "Bryant enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 15-seed with a 23-12 record, but that modest seed significantly undersells what this team accomplished in conference play. The Bulldogs won the America East regular-season title outright at 14-2, then ran through the conference tournament to earn an automatic bid \u2014 the program's first AEA title since joining the league, snapping Vermont's eight-year stranglehold on the conference. However, their non-conference r\u00e9sum\u00e9 raises legitimate red flags against higher-caliber competition: losses to St. John's (99-77), St. Bonaventure (85-70), Chattanooga (84-76), and Brown (76-75 on a buzzer-beater) reveal a team that struggles to compete with mid-major and low-major power programs outside its own league. Bryant went a combined 0-4 against those programs, with the St. John's and St. Bonaventure defeats being particularly lopsided. There are no documented wins against ranked opponents in the provided summaries, making their tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9 almost entirely built on America East dominance against limited competition.\n\nHeading into the tournament, Bryant is playing its best basketball of the season. Their final five games \u2014 wins over New Hampshire (90-56), UMBC (85-74), Albany (91-78), and Maine (77-59) in the conference tournament, plus the regular-season title-clincher over New Hampshire \u2014 show a team winning comfortably and with purpose, outscoring opponents by an average of roughly 20 points across that stretch. The engine of this team is Rafael Pinzon, a relentless scorer who regularly delivers 20-30 point performances and has been the Bulldogs' most consistent option all season, posting 22, 28, 17, 22, and then tournament runs of similar output. Earl Timberlake is a legitimate double-double threat \u2014 athletic, versatile, and capable of impacting the game in multiple ways simultaneously, as evidenced by his 21-point, 9-rebound, 8-assist, 4-block line against Albany in January. Connor Withers provides floor-spacing and playmaking, and Barry Evans gives Bryant a reliable third scoring option with rebounding punch. The Bulldogs play an up-tempo, high-scoring style and can put up points in bunches, but they have also proven collapse-prone in close games \u2014 losses to Siena in overtime, Brown on a last-second three, Fordham on a buzzer-beater three, and Stonehill by one point suggest this team has a troubling habit of letting winnable games slip away. At home, Bryant is noticeably stronger, building comfortable leads and controlling pace; on the road and at neutral sites, they are more vulnerable, as demonstrated by their early-season road losses. Their conference tournament run on a neutral site is an encouraging data point, but those wins came against America East opponents who have no bearing on what awaits in the NCAA bracket. As a 15-seed, Bryant is a dangerous, high-energy team with real star power in Pinzon and Timberlake, but the lack of any quality wins, a history of late-game collapses, and non-conference blowout losses to mid-major programs make a first-round upset extremely difficult to sustain. **Realistic tournament ceiling: First-round exit** \u2014 Bryant is a lively 15-seed that could keep a game close in the first half, but they do not have the defensive discipline, consistent depth, or proven big-game composure to pull off an upset against a high-major 2-seed.",

Kwame Evans Jr. had 11 points and 11 rebounds off the bench and TJ Bamba had 10 points and four assists. Osobor led the Huskies with 21 points, four assists and three steals in the final game of his senior season. Zoom Diallo scored 13 points with five assists, Frank Kepnang had 12 points and seven rebounds, Mason contributed 11 points and Tyler Harris chipped in 10 points and six rebounds. ------ AP college basketball: and",
      "2025-03-13 - Oregon: 72 vs Indiana: 59\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Jackson Shelstad had 18 points and TJ Bamba scored 17 to help No. 23 Oregon pull away late for a 72-59 victory over Indiana in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament on Thursday. The Ducks (24-8) head into Friday's quarterfinal round against No. 7 Michigan State, the Big Ten regular-season champs, riding an eight-game winning streak. Indiana (19-13) lost to Oregon for the second time in nine days and now must wait until Sunday to see if it makes the 68-team NCAA Tournament field. Malik Reneau scored 19 points to lead the Hoosiers, while Trey Galloway added 15 points and nine assists. Oregon took control by scoring the final 10 points of the first half, giving it a 37-29 lead and sealed the victory with a late 9-0 run to take a 65-56 lead. Indiana couldn't recover from either spurt. Takeaways Indiana: The Hoosiers may have done enough to make the tourney field. The question is whether they'll avoid a First Four game in Dayton, Ohio. They have no control over that now. Oregon: The Ducks didn't earn a lot of style points, but they did advance to Friday's quarterfinal round \u2014 and in March, that's all that matters. Key moment After the Hoosiers cut the deficit to 56-54 with 7:32 to play, Indiana was held scoreless for the next 5:28. Key stat Indiana was 5 of 10 at the free-throw line and Oregon made eight 3-pointers compared with only four for the Hoosiers. Up next Oregon will try to get even with the Spartans after losing 86-74 in East Lansing, Michigan, on Feb. 8. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "2025-03-14 - Michigan State: 74 vs Oregon: 64\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- \u2014 Jase Richardson scored 17 points and Jeremy Fears Jr. added 11 points and five assists to lead No. 7 Michigan State past No. 23 Oregon 74-64 in the first of Friday's four Big Ten Tournament quarterfinal games. The Spartans (27-5) have now won eight straight, matching a season best. The league's regular-season champion will face either No. 18 Wisconsin or fourth-seeded UCLA in Saturday's first semifinal game. Jaden Akins had 12 points for the Spartans while Coen Carr had 10 points and eight rebounds. Nate Bittle finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Ducks (24-9). TJ Bamba added 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. Michigan State scored the final seven points of the first half to take a 42-32 lead and used a 15-0 second half run to pull away after Oregon had cut the deficit to 44-43 with 15:33 left. Takeaways Oregon: The Ducks certainly made a case for improving their NCAA Tournament seed with two solid showings in Indianapolis. Though they didn't reach the semifinals, they played well enough for 25 minutes Friday to help their cause. Michigan State: Coach Tom Izzo's team is playing like a Final Four contender. Can the Spartans get a No. 1 seed? That may be too much to ask since they'd need substantial help this weekend, but sweeping the Big Ten titles would help. Key moment Michigan State responded to Izzo's timeout after Oregon made it a one-point game by pitching a shutout over the next nearly 5 1/2 minutes. Key stat Despite only a 36-29 rebounding advantage, Michigan State outscored Oregon 16-4 in second-chance points. Up next The Spartans beat Wisconsin and lost to UCLA in their only meetings this season. Oregon will find out its next matchup on Selection Sunday. ------ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here. AP college basketball: and"

    "profile_summary": "Oregon enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 5-seed with a 25-10 record, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 built on genuine early-season excellence that was tested \u2014 and occasionally cracked \u2014 by the demands of Big Ten play. The Ducks started 13-1 and cracked the top 10, logging impressive wins over then-ranked Alabama (83-81 on a Nate Bittle putback dunk with 4.4 seconds left), Texas A&M (80-70), and San Diego State (78-68) in neutral-site tournament play. Against ranked opponents, Oregon went roughly 5-8 on the season, with quality victories over Alabama, Texas A&M, Wisconsin (77-73 in OT), and Ohio State (73-71 on the road), but also suffered blowout losses to Illinois (109-77 at home), Michigan State (86-74), and UCLA twice, including a humiliating 78-52 road demolition. The Ducks hit a brutal mid-February skid, losing five straight for the first time since 2013-14, before reeling off eight consecutive wins to close the year. Their final five games tell an encouraging story: a 75-57 home win over Rutgers, an 80-78 road escape at Iowa on Bittle's clutch late block, a 77-73 overtime road win at No. 11 Wisconsin on a Shelstad desperation three, an 82-61 home blowout of USC, and a 73-64 home win over Indiana, capped by two solid Big Ten Tournament showings \u2014 a 72-59 win over Indiana and a competitive 74-64 loss to No. 7 Michigan State in which Oregon cut the deficit to one before the Spartans used a 15-0 run to pull away.\n\nOregon's identity is rooted in resilience and depth rather than dominance, with multiple players capable of taking over on any given night \u2014 though that same collective approach occasionally produces troubling offensive droughts. Jackson Shelstad is the engine, averaging big numbers down the stretch and delivering in clutch moments, including a 26-point career-high against Northwestern to snap the losing streak and back-to-back game-deciding free throws at Ohio State. Nate Bittle is a legitimate two-way force \u2014 his 36-point, 12-rebound regular-season finale at Washington and five-block performance against Rutgers project as genuine tournament-level production \u2014 and his ability to alter shots and command the paint gives Oregon a defensive anchor few 5-seeds can match. TJ Bamba provides scoring punch from multiple areas, Keeshawn Barthelemy is a dangerous microwave scorer off the bench, and Brandon Angel offers versatile wing play, giving Dana Altman genuine eight-man rotation depth. However, this team is strikingly split by location: Oregon went 8-0 on true road games and 4-0 on neutral courts, while going just 13-8 at home, suggesting the neutral-site tournament environment actually suits them well. The recurring concern is their vulnerability to elite interior pressure and perimeter shooting \u2014 Illinois torched them for 55% on threes, and UCLA buried 12-of-23 in a sweep \u2014 and their 3-point shooting has been wildly inconsistent, going 4-of-23 in the UCLA blowout. Still, a team that closes the year with eight straight wins, beats a top-10 Wisconsin squad on the road in overtime, and nearly hangs with a potential No. 1 seed Michigan State team in the Big Ten Tournament is a genuine threat. **Oregon's realistic tournament ceiling is the Sweet 16**: athletic, deep, and battle-tested enough to knock off a 4-seed in the second round, but their defensive lapses against elite perimeter shooting and inability to sustain leads against top-10 opponents make a run to the Elite Eight a stretch.",

    "profile_summary": "Liberty enters the 2025 NCAA Tournament as a 12-seed with an impressive 28-7 record, having won the Conference USA regular season title and tournament championship \u2014 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects genuine mid-major excellence, though questions about performance against elite competition linger. The Flames' most notable quality win came early in the season at the Paradise Jam, where they knocked off Kansas State 67-65 on a Colin Porter 3-pointer with 2:31 remaining \u2014 a legitimate statement win over a Power conference opponent. Their losses are a mixed bag: tight defeats to Florida Atlantic (in overtime), Western Kentucky (on a buzzer-beating 3), UTEP (on a last-second jumper), and Louisiana Tech reveal a team that is regularly competitive but prone to late-game collapses in close games, often losing on the final possession rather than being dominated. Entering the tournament, Liberty's last five games have been outstanding \u2014 wins over Middle Tennessee (86-81), Western Kentucky (90-61), UTEP (81-60 in the C-USA quarterfinals), Kennesaw State (81-79 in the semis), and Jacksonville State (79-67 in the C-USA title game) represent their best sustained stretch of the season and confirm genuine momentum. The Conference USA tournament run was particularly telling: they rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit against Kennesaw State on the strength of Kaden Metheny's 16 second-half points, demonstrating both resilience and the star-power needed for tournament runs.\n\nLiberty's identity is built around a deep, multi-threat offense with no shortage of capable scorers. Taelon Peter is playing at an elite level \u2014 his 33-point outing at Middle Tennessee (11-of-14 from the field) was the most impressive individual performance of the season and signals he is peaking at the right time. Metheny is a reliable engine, capable of exploding from three (7-of-13 in the C-USA semis), and Zach Cleveland functions as a steady, high-IQ playmaker who also contributed 19 points and six assists against UTEP in the tournament. Owen Aquino provides rebounding and interior presence, while Colin Porter and Jay Maughmer offer serviceable depth. Crucially, Liberty is a team that plays better at home (dominant in Lynchburg) and on neutral sites \u2014 their 7-1 record at neutral sites, including the Paradise Jam championship and the full C-USA tournament run, is genuinely encouraging for an NCAA tournament setting. However, they are 2-4 in true road games, and their tendency to lose tight games on the final possession raises legitimate concerns about execution under pressure against higher-caliber defenses. This is a dangerous, well-constructed mid-major with real offensive firepower and tournament experience, but their inability to beat ranked or upper-echelon opponents consistently caps their ceiling. **Realistic tournament verdict: Liberty is a prototypical dangerous 12-seed capable of pulling off a first-round upset, but is unlikely to advance past the Sweet 16 \u2014 a second-round exit is the most probable outcome.**",
