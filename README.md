# Analytics for March Madness Pools

## Overview
The most common objective in March Madness is to predict a perfect bracket. Every year, millions of brackets of are filled out,
with the chances of one being perfect being approximately 1 in 9.2 quintillion. While one wrong pick ruins an entire bracket, 
and often a lot fun for many fans, there is another way to play the game.

The March Madness pool is a pool of players, each of whom put together a collection of 8 teams in the NCAA tournament field.
Teams are auctioned off to each player, with the end goal of having the collection of teams with the most wins in the tournament.


The goal of this project is to predict how a team will perform in the tournament. A probability distribution will be 
calculated to determine the likelihood of any team in the field winning 0 games, 1 game, or 2+ games. In addition, the 
3 most similar teams (since 2009-10) will also be calculated.
